# The Daily Hire - Writing Style Guide

This guide defines the voice, tone, and style for all content on The Daily Hire blog.

## Brand Voice

**The Daily Hire** is the recruiting blog that doesn't sound like a recruiting blog. We're here to educate, entertain, and call out the BS in the industry—all while keeping it 100.

### Core Principles
1. **Authentic** - No corporate speak, no buzzwords (unless we're roasting them)
2. **Conversational** - Write like you're texting your work bestie
3. **Informative** - Always provide value, even when being funny
4. **Direct** - Say what you mean, skip the fluff
5. **Self-Aware** - We know we're dramatic, and we own it

## Tone by Category

### NEWS
**Tone:** Informed but sassy, breaking down industry trends with hot takes

**Example:**
> Listen up, because AI is straight-up eating the recruiting game for breakfast right now. We're talking about tools that can screen thousands of resumes faster than you can say "culture fit."

**Do:**
- Lead with impact
- Use current events and trends
- Include data/statistics when available
- Provide actionable insights
- Call out industry problems

**Don't:**
- Be boring or overly formal
- Use outdated references
- Write clickbait without substance

---

### TOOLS
**Tone:** Helpful expert who's tested everything and won't sugarcoat

**Example:**
> Let's keep it 100: If you're still using an ATS from 2020, you're basically recruiting with a flip phone. Technology moved on, bestie.

**Do:**
- Give honest reviews
- List specific features/pros/cons
- Include pricing when relevant
- Compare alternatives
- Recommend based on use cases

**Don't:**
- Sound like a sales pitch
- Review tools you haven't researched
- Ignore obvious flaws

---

### AI FUNNIES
**Tone:** Playful chaos energy, laughing WITH (not at) the absurdity

**Example:**
> Resume #1: Guy with zero experience but lists "vibes" as a core competency
> AI: "Excellent cultural fit for Senior Leadership role! 98% match!"

**Do:**
- Tell entertaining stories
- Include dialogue/examples
- Find humor in AI fails
- Still teach a lesson
- Use dramatic flair

**Don't:**
- Be mean-spirited
- Punch down at candidates
- Make things up (base on real scenarios)

---

### JUST THE TIP
**Tone:** No-BS mentor dropping knowledge bombs

**Example:**
> Real talk: Your job descriptions are probably why you're getting crickets from top talent. Let's fix that.

**Do:**
- Be concise and actionable
- Use bold headers for quick scanning
- Include specific examples
- Give step-by-step when possible
- End with clear takeaway

**Don't:**
- Over-explain
- Write long paragraphs
- Be vague ("do better" isn't helpful)

## Language & Style

### Vocabulary

**USE THIS:**
- Slaps, hits different, low-key, high-key
- No cap, fam, bestie
- The tea, the vibe, the energy
- 100, undefeated, chef's kiss
- Giving [x] energy (e.g., "giving corporate cringe")
- It's giving [x] (e.g., "It's giving Big Brother vibes")

**USE SPARINGLY:**
- Slay, queen, king (can feel dated)
- Too many emojis in body text
- Outdated slang (fleek, bae, etc.)

**NEVER USE:**
- Synergy, leverage, circle back
- Move the needle, low-hanging fruit
- Deep dive, unpack (ironically okay)
- Any corporate jargon we're not actively roasting

### Sentence Structure

**Good:**
> The right ATS should feel like it's doing half your job. If it's not, it's time to swipe left.

**Bad:**
> A quality Applicant Tracking System should significantly streamline your recruitment workflow processes.

**Rules:**
- Short sentences > long sentences
- Active voice > passive voice
- Contractions are your friend (you're, it's, we'll)
- Break grammar rules for emphasis. Seriously.
- One-sentence paragraphs are allowed

### Formatting

#### Headers
```markdown
## Use Title Case for H2s
### Use Title Case for H3s Too
```

#### Lists
- Use bullet points for scanning
- Keep items concise
- Parallel structure when possible

#### Emphasis
- **Bold** for important points
- *Italics* for slight emphasis
- ALL CAPS for impact (use sparingly)
- "Quotes" for sarcasm or highlighting phrases

## Writing Patterns

### Strong Openings

**Pattern 1: The Call-Out**
> Listen up, because [controversial statement]. Here's why you should care.

**Pattern 2: The Truth Bomb**
> Real talk: [common problem]. Let's fix that.

**Pattern 3: The Scenario**
> Picture this: [relatable situation]. Sound familiar?

### Compelling Headlines

**Formula 1: Problem + Solution**
> "Your ATS is Trash: 10 Features That Actually Matter"

**Formula 2: Provocative Statement**
> "Remote Work Broke Recruiting and Nobody's Mad About It"

**Formula 3: Unexpected Combo**
> "ChatGPT Said Every Candidate Is a 'Perfect Fit' and We Can't Stop Laughing"

**Formula 4: Direct Address**
> "Stop Writing Job Descriptions Like It's 1995 (Respectfully)"

### Section Transitions

Instead of boring transitions like "Additionally" or "Furthermore," use:
- "But here's where it gets spicy:"
- "The plot twist?"
- "Now here's the tea:"
- "The real question is:"
- "Bottom line:"

### Strong Endings

**Pattern 1: Call to Action**
> The window is closing fast. Move fast, make compelling offers, and don't sleep on this opportunity.

**Pattern 2: Summary + Punch**
> Use AI to save time, not to replace human judgment. Otherwise you'll end up interviewing someone whose main qualification is "good at memes."

**Pattern 3: Mic Drop**
> Your job description is your first impression. Make it slap, not cringe.

## Content Structure

### Ideal Article Flow

1. **Hook** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Grab attention immediately
   - State the problem or premise
   - Make them want to keep reading

2. **Context** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Why this matters
   - Current state of affairs
   - Set up the main content

3. **Main Content** (3-5 sections)
   - Use clear H2/H3 headers
   - Mix paragraphs with lists
   - Include examples/stories
   - Break up with bold text

4. **Takeaway** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Summarize key points
   - Provide actionable next steps
   - End with impact

### Paragraph Length
- **Ideal:** 2-4 sentences
- **Maximum:** 5 sentences
- **Single-sentence paragraphs:** Totally fine for emphasis

### Section Length
- Break up long sections with subheaders
- Aim for 3-5 paragraphs per section
- Use visual variety (lists, bold, etc.)

## Voice Guidelines

### Be Direct
**Good:** "Delete it."
**Bad:** "You might want to consider removing this element."

### Be Confident
**Good:** "This is the best ATS on the market."
**Bad:** "This might potentially be a good option to consider."

### Be Relatable
**Good:** "We've all been there."
**Bad:** "One may find oneself in this situation."

### Be Honest
**Good:** "Look, it's expensive. But here's why it's worth it."
**Bad:** "This premium solution offers excellent value."

### Use Humor (But Stay Informative)
**Good:** "AI said every candidate was perfect. Spoiler: They weren't."
**Bad:** "The AI system produced humorous results." (too dry)
**Also Bad:** "LOL AI is so dumb rofl" (too silly, no value)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't:
- Use "I think" or "I believe" (be confident)
- Write "In today's digital age" or similar clichés
- Explain the obvious
- Be condescending
- Forget your audience (recruiters, HR pros, TA specialists)
- Sacrifice accuracy for entertainment
- Use offensive language or punch down

### ✅ Do:
- Write like you speak
- Include specific examples
- Back up claims with logic/data
- Acknowledge nuance when needed
- Keep the energy consistent
- Edit ruthlessly
- Read it out loud before publishing

## SEO Without Selling Out

### Keywords
- Include naturally in title
- Mention in first paragraph
- Use in subheaders
- Don't force it

### Readability
- Short paragraphs
- Clear headers
- Bullet points
- Bold key phrases

### Value First
- Never sacrifice quality for SEO
- If it sounds robotic, rewrite it
- Readers > search engines

## Examples of Great vs. Meh Writing

### Example 1: Opening Lines

**Meh:**
> Artificial Intelligence is transforming the recruiting industry in many ways. In this article, we'll explore how AI screening tools work.

**Great:**
> Listen up, because AI is straight-up eating the recruiting game for breakfast right now. We're talking about tools that can screen thousands of resumes faster than you can say "culture fit."

---

### Example 2: Explaining Features

**Meh:**
> The system includes an AI-powered matching feature that helps identify qualified candidates.

**Great:**
> AI-Powered Matching: Because manually screening 500 resumes is not the vibe

---

### Example 3: Conclusions

**Meh:**
> In conclusion, these tools can be helpful for modern recruiters who want to improve their processes.

**Great:**
> The right ATS should feel like it's doing half your job. If it's not, it's time to swipe left.

## Final Checklist

Before publishing, ask yourself:

- [ ] Would I actually send this to a friend?
- [ ] Did I cut all the boring parts?
- [ ] Is there at least one memorable line?
- [ ] Does it provide real value?
- [ ] Is it scannable? (headers, lists, bold)
- [ ] Does it match our brand voice?
- [ ] Would I click on this headline?
- [ ] Is it honest and accurate?

The Daily Hire is giving **knowledgeable friend energy**, not **corporate press release energy**.

When in doubt: **Be bold. Be direct. Be you.**
