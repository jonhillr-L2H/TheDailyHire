You made an offer. The candidate accepted. You're celebrating.

Then they call: "My current employer just countered with a higher salary. I need to think about it."

70% of candidates who accept counteroffers leave within 12 months anyway. But in the moment, they're torn.

Here's how to handle counteroffers without overpaying or losing great candidates.

## Why Counteroffers Happen

Candidates resign. Employers panic and scramble to keep them.

**Typical counteroffer:**
- 10-20% salary increase
- Promotion or new title
- Promises of "things will get better"
- Guilt ("you're leaving the team hanging")

**Why employers counter:**
- Losing someone mid-project is painful
- Hiring replacements is expensive
- They don't want to look bad to leadership

Most counteroffers are reactive panic, not genuine commitment.

## How To Respond When A Candidate Mentions A Counteroffer

**Step 1: Stay calm**

Don't panic. Don't get defensive. Don't increase your offer immediately.

**Step 2: Ask questions**

"What did they offer? Is it just salary, or are there other changes?"

"What made you start looking in the first place? Does the counteroffer address those reasons?"

**Step 3: Remind them why they were leaving**

"You mentioned you were frustrated with lack of growth opportunities. Does the counteroffer include a clear development plan?"

Most counteroffers are salary bumps without addressing root problems.

## What To Say (And Not Say)

**Good responses:**

✅ "I understand counteroffers are tempting. What do you think has changed at your current company that makes you want to stay?"

✅ "70% of people who accept counteroffers leave within a year anyway. Will this really solve the issues you raised?"

✅ "If they valued you this much, why did it take you resigning for them to offer a raise?"

**Bad responses:**

❌ "We can match that!" (You're in a bidding war now)

❌ "You gave us your word." (Guilt doesn't work)

❌ "You're making a huge mistake." (Condescending)

## When To Increase Your Offer (And When Not To)

**Increase your offer if:**
- The counteroffer revealed market data you didn't have
- You were below market and can justify adjusting
- The candidate is exceptional and worth it

**Don't increase if:**
- You're already at market rate
- The candidate is using you as leverage
- It would create internal equity issues

**How to decide:**

"Our offer was based on market data and internal equity. We believe it's fair. If salary is the only factor, I understand if you choose the counteroffer. But if career growth and the role itself matter, we're still the better choice."

## The 70% Rule: Most Counteroffer Acceptances Fail

**Research shows:**
- 50-80% of employees who accept counteroffers leave within 6-12 months
- They're often first in line for layoffs (seen as flight risks)
- Original problems that drove them to look don't get solved

**Share this with candidates:**

"I want you to make the best decision for you. But research shows 70% of people who accept counteroffers end up leaving anyway. The issues that made you start looking—are they really solved?"

## The Bottom Line

**When candidates get counteroffers:**

1. Stay calm, don't panic
2. Ask what the counteroffer includes
3. Remind them why they were leaving
4. Share the 70% stat (most counteroffer acceptances fail)
5. Only increase your offer if genuinely justified

Don't get into bidding wars. If a candidate chooses money over fit, they'll leave anyway when the next offer arrives.
