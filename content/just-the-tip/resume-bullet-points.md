[Your resume probably says things like "Responsible for managing social media accounts" or "Handled customer inquiries](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/weak-resume-bullets)." [These bullets are killing your chances because they're boring task lists, not accomplishments](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-accomplishment-vs-duty).

Let me show you exactly how to fix this.

## The Formula: Action + Result + Context

[Every resume bullet should follow this pattern](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-bullet-formula):
- **Action:** What you did
- **Result:** What happened because you did it (with numbers)
- **Context:** Why it mattered

[Boring version: "Managed email marketing campaigns"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/task-focused-resume-bullets)

[Strong version: "Redesigned email marketing strategy, increasing open rates by 47% and generating $200K in additional revenue over 6 months"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/results-focused-resume-example)

See the difference? [One tells me you had a job. The other tells me you were good at it](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/demonstrating-impact-resume).

## Real Examples: Before and After

**Marketing:**

❌ **Before:** "Managed social media accounts for the company"

✅ **After:** ["Grew Instagram following from 2K to 25K in 8 months through strategic content calendar and influencer partnerships, driving 300+ qualified leads](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/social-media-resume-accomplishment)"

**Sales:**

❌ **Before:** "Responsible for meeting sales quotas"

✅ **After:** ["Exceeded quota by 156% in Q4 2024, closing $1.2M in new business—highest performance on 12-person team](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/sales-achievement-quantification)"

**Project Management:**

❌ **Before:** "Led cross-functional projects"

✅ **After:** ["Coordinated 8-person cross-functional team to deliver product launch 2 weeks ahead of schedule and 15% under budget, resulting in $500K first-quarter revenue](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/project-management-impact-statement)"

**Customer Service:**

❌ **Before:** "Handled customer complaints"

✅ **After:** ["Resolved 95% of customer complaints on first contact (15% above team average), improving customer satisfaction scores from 3.2 to 4.6 stars over 6 months](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/customer-service-metrics-resume)"

**Operations:**

❌ **Before:** "Improved processes and procedures"

✅ **After:** ["Streamlined inventory management process, reducing stock discrepancies by 78% and saving 12 hours per week in manual reconciliation](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/operational-improvement-quantified)"

**HR/Recruiting:**

❌ **Before:** "Recruited candidates for various positions"

✅ **After:** ["Filled 32 roles in 6 months with average time-to-hire of 24 days (vs. company average of 42 days), maintaining 94% offer acceptance rate](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/recruiting-metrics-resume-example)"

## The Numbers That Matter

[Not every bullet needs a percentage, but specific numbers are always better than vague claims](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/quantifying-resume-achievements). Use:

- **Percentages:** "Increased X by 40%"
- **Dollar amounts:** "Generated $250K in revenue"
- **Time saved:** "Reduced processing time from 4 hours to 45 minutes"
- **Volume:** "Managed budget of $2M" or "Served 200+ clients"
- **Rankings:** "Top performer out of 15-person team"
- **Frequency:** "Delivered 3 reports weekly to C-suite"

[If you genuinely don't have numbers, use these approaches](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/resume-bullets-without-numbers):

**Show scope:** ["Managed social media presence across 5 platforms for 50K+ follower audience](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/scope-indication-resume)"

**Show impact qualitatively:** ["Created onboarding process adopted company-wide, becoming standard practice for all new hires](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/qualitative-impact-statement)"

**Show recognition:** ["Selected to present strategy to executive leadership team based on campaign performance](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recognition-as-impact-indicator)"

## What to Do If You Don't Know Your Numbers

[Go back and figure them out](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/researching-past-accomplishments):

- [Check old emails, reports, or presentations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/mining-past-work-metrics)
- [Ask former managers or colleagues](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/requesting-performance-data)
- [Look at before/after metrics from when you started vs. when you left](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/baseline-vs-endpoint-metrics)
- [Make reasonable estimates if you have to, but be able to back them up if asked](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/estimated-metrics-honesty)

[Don't guess wildly or make up numbers—that's lying and you will get caught](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employment-law-compliance/resume-fraud-consequences). [But "approximately" and "roughly" are acceptable if you're in the ballpark](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reasonable-approximations-resume).

## Action Verbs That Actually Mean Something

[Ditch weak verbs like "responsible for," "handled," or "helped with](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/weak-resume-verbs-avoid)." [Use strong action verbs](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/powerful-resume-action-verbs):

**Leadership:** Led, Directed, Managed, Coordinated, Spearheaded
**Growth:** Grew, Increased, Expanded, Scaled, Boosted
**Efficiency:** Streamlined, Optimized, Reduced, Automated, Simplified
**Creation:** Built, Developed, Designed, Created, Launched
**Results:** Generated, Delivered, Achieved, Exceeded, Drove

[But don't just swap in fancy verbs—make sure they're accurate](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/accurate-verb-selection). ["Spearheaded" implies you led it from the beginning. "Contributed to" is more honest if you were part of a team](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/verb-accuracy-resume).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't use the same verb for every bullet.** ["Managed X, managed Y, managed Z" is boring and shows no range](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/verb-variety-resume).

**Don't write paragraphs.** [Each bullet should be one or two lines max](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/resume-bullet-length). [Recruiters skim—make it easy](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-resume-scanning-behavior).

**Don't list obvious job duties.** [If it's in every job description for that role, it doesn't differentiate you](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/differentiating-resume-content). ["Answered phones" for a receptionist doesn't help. "Managed 100+ daily calls while maintaining 98% satisfaction score" does](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/transforming-basic-duties).

**Don't go back too far.** [Focus bullets on your last 10 years](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/resume-work-history-length). [Earlier roles can be brief or summarized](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/older-experience-resume-treatment).

**Don't forget to update.** [If you accomplished something new last month, add it](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/keeping-resume-current). [Your resume should be a living document](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/resume-maintenance-practice).

## The 10-Minute Fix

[You can improve your resume significantly in 10 minutes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/quick-resume-improvement):

1. [Pick your 3 most recent roles](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/prioritizing-resume-updates)
2. [Identify your top 2-3 accomplishments in each role](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/identifying-key-achievements)
3. [Rewrite those bullets using Action + Result + Context](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/accomplishment-bullet-rewrite)
4. [Add numbers wherever possible](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/quantification-resume-bullets)

[That's it. Those 6-9 bullets are what will get you interviews](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/most-important-resume-bullets). [The rest is supporting detail](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-content-hierarchy).

## The Bottom Line

[Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on your resume](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-screening-time-statistics). [In those seconds, they're looking for proof you can do the job](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/resume-scanning-focus). [Task lists don't prove anything. Results do](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/results-vs-responsibilities).

[Transform your bullets from "this is what I was supposed to do" to "this is what I actually achieved](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/achievement-focused-resume-transformation)." [The difference between getting interviews and getting ghosted often comes down to how you present your experience](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-presentation-interview-rate).

[Take the 10 minutes. Fix your bullets. Get more interviews](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/resume-improvement-roi). [It's literally that simple](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/simple-resume-fixes-impact).
