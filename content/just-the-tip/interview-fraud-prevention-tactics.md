[Interview fraud is happening more than you think—7% of candidates admit to it](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025). Someone else takes the technical interview, the real candidate shows up on day one, and suddenly they can't do basic tasks they "aced" during screening.

[Remote interviews made this easier to pull off](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025), but you can catch it if you know what to look for. Here's how to protect yourself without turning your interview process into a TSA checkpoint.

## Red Flag #1: Performance Varies Wildly Between Interview Rounds

**What it looks like:** Candidate crushes the technical screen but struggles with basic questions in the behavioral interview. Or vice versa.

**Why it matters:** [Different people interviewing for them across different rounds](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends). The technical expert handles tech screens, but can't answer culture fit questions.

**What to do:** Have the same interviewer (or panel) conduct at least two rounds. [Consistency in knowledge and communication style across interviews is a good signal](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025).

## Red Flag #2: Camera Issues That Never Get Fixed

**What it looks like:** Camera is always "broken," positioned strangely, or mysteriously stops working mid-interview across multiple calls.

**Why it matters:** [Makes it easier to have someone off-camera coaching or taking over entirely](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

**What to do:** Make camera participation mandatory for all rounds. If someone can't get their camera working after two attempts, they're either technically incompetent (bad for a technical role) or hiding something (bad for any role).

Exception: Candidates with legitimate accessibility needs. But that should be communicated upfront, not discovered during the interview.

## Red Flag #3: Long Pauses Before Every Answer

**What it looks like:** Candidate pauses 5-10 seconds before answering even simple questions. Responses sound rehearsed or like they're being read.

**Why it matters:** [They might be receiving answers through an earpiece or waiting for someone off-camera to feed them responses](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025).

**What to do:** Ask follow-up questions that require spontaneous thinking. Don't just stick to your script. If they nail the prepared questions but can't handle "Can you elaborate on that?" or "Give me a specific example," something's off.

## Red Flag #4: Communication Style Changes Between Written and Verbal

**What it looks like:** Their emails are polished and technical, but verbal communication is poor. Or they write poorly but speak impressively well.

**Why it matters:** [Different people might be handling different communication channels](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

**What to do:** Pay attention to consistency across email, phone screens, video interviews, and written assessments. Big discrepancies warrant investigation.

## Prevention Tactic #1: Identity Verification (Do It Early)

**The move:** [Require candidates to show government-issued ID on camera at the start of technical or final interviews](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html).

Frame it professionally: "Before we begin, I need to verify your identity for our records. Can you hold up a government-issued ID to the camera?"

Most legitimate candidates won't mind. Fraudsters will scramble or drop out.

**Bonus:** [Use identity verification platforms that match photo IDs with video participants using biometric analysis](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html). This isn't paranoid—it's smart risk management when hiring remote workers.

## Prevention Tactic #2: Live Skills Validation (Not Just Take-Home Tests)

**The problem:** Take-home coding challenges or project assignments can be outsourced. Someone else does the work, submits it under the candidate's name.

**The fix:** [Always follow up take-home work with live validation](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends). Have them walk through their solution, explain their thinking, or make a small modification live.

Example for developers: "Great project. Can you open it up and show me how you implemented [specific feature]? Now can you modify it to do X instead of Y?"

If they can't navigate their own code or explain their approach, they didn't write it.

## Prevention Tactic #3: Consistent Interview Panel

**Why it works:** [Same interviewers across multiple rounds can spot inconsistencies in knowledge, communication style, and behavioral responses](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025).

**How to implement:** Have at least one interviewer participate in both the technical and behavioral rounds. They'll notice if the candidate seems like two different people.

## Prevention Tactic #4: Ask Unscripted Follow-Ups

**The approach:** [Don't just run through your list of prepared questions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025). Ask follow-ups based on their answers.

If they mention working with Python: "What version? What libraries did you use most? Walk me through a specific problem you solved."

Fraudsters prepare for common interview questions. They don't prepare for deep dives into their supposed experience.

## Prevention Tactic #5: First Week Skills Check

**The reality:** Even with good vetting, some fraud slips through. [Catch it in the first week, not the first month](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

**How:** Quick practical assessments during onboarding. Not extensive testing—just basic confirmation that they can do what they claimed.

For developers: Pair programming session on day 2-3.
For analysts: Review a dataset and present findings.
For sales: Role-play a discovery call with a manager.

If someone "aced" the technical interview but can't do basic tasks during onboarding, you caught fraud. Better to discover it in week one than week twelve.

## What to Do When You Catch Fraud

**Document everything.** [Save interview recordings, transcripts, and notes](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025). If someone committed fraud during the interview process, you'll need evidence.

**Terminate immediately.** This isn't a performance issue you coach through. [Fraud during interviews is grounds for immediate termination](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025). Check with legal, but don't drag it out.

**Consider reporting.** Depending on severity and your legal team's advice, you might report to authorities. [Interview fraud is becoming a bigger problem and repeat offenders exist](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

**Learn from it.** What signals did you miss? How did they get through your process? Adjust your vetting to prevent it next time.

## The Balance: Verification Without Paranoia

You don't want to treat every candidate like a criminal. [Most people are honest and legitimate](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025). But the 7% who aren't can cause serious damage—bad hires, team disruption, wasted time, lost money.

The goal: Simple verification steps that catch fraud without alienating real candidates.

**Good verification:**
- Camera-on requirements (standard in 2025)
- ID check before final interviews (quick, professional)
- Live skills validation after take-home work (reasonable)
- Consistency checks across interview rounds (smart process)

**Bad verification:**
- Interrogating candidates about why their camera positioning looks weird
- Requiring extensive background checks before initial interviews
- Treating every pause as suspicious
- Making candidates feel like you don't trust them

[Verify professionally, catch fraud early, move good candidates through quickly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025). That's the balance.

## The Bottom Line

[Interview fraud is real, it's growing, and remote work makes it easier](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025). You can catch it with:

✅ Camera-mandatory interviews
✅ ID verification before technical/final rounds
✅ Live skills validation after take-home work
✅ Consistent interviewers across rounds
✅ Unscripted follow-up questions
✅ First-week skills checks

[Most candidates are legitimate. But 7% aren't, and you need systems to catch them before they show up on day one unable to do the job](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

That's the tip. Use it.
