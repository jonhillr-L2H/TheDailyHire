The holidays are prime time for "new year, new job" energy. Your pipeline candidates are evaluating their careers over pumpkin pie. The question: how do you stay top-of-mind without seeming thirsty?

## Why End-of-Year Touchpoints Matter

People get reflective between Thanksgiving and New Year's. They're thinking about what they accomplished, what they're unhappy with, and whether they want to spend another year in their current role. Your timing isn't random, it's strategic.

Bonus season announcements happen in December/January. Candidates find out they're getting lowballed, getting passed over for promotion, or getting nothing. That's your window.

## The Touchpoint That Works

"Hey [Name], heading into year-end and wanted to check in. How's everything going on your end? Still happy at [Company] or open to exploring what's out there?"

Simple. Direct. Not pretending you're texting because you miss them personally. You're a recruiter doing your job, they're professionals who understand the game.

## Add Value, Not Just Asks

Share something useful: industry insights, salary data, company intel. "Saw this report on [their industry] compensation trends - thought you might find it interesting" shows you're thinking about their career, not just your commission.

Reference specific conversations. "You mentioned wanting to move into management - I've got a few leadership roles that might fit if you're open to chatting." Proves you were paying attention, not blast-texting your entire database.

## Timing the Message

Day before Thanksgiving: people are busy, bad timing. Week after Thanksgiving: holiday shopping chaos, also bad. First week of December: actually decent. Mid-December through New Year's: hit or miss.

Early January: prime time. Bonuses are announced (or disappointingly not announced), people are setting goals, energy is high. Your "Happy New Year - let's catch up about your 2025 plans" lands perfectly.

## The Multi-Touch Approach

November check-in: "Thinking about 2025 goals? Let me know if you want to explore options."

December follow-up: Share valuable content, no hard ask. Stay visible.

January outreach: "New year, new opportunities - want to chat about what you're looking for?"

You're nurturing the relationship, not demanding immediate action. Pipeline management is a long game.

## What Not to Do

Don't: "Are you STILL happy at your job?" (aggressive)

Don't: "Checking in because I have quotas to hit" (honest but stupid)

Don't: "Just circling back!!!" followed by five more follow-ups (desperate and annoying)

Don't: Pretend you're texting for any reason other than professional relationship maintenance. They know. You know. Everyone knows.

## Handling the Responses

"I'm happy where I am" = stay in touch quarterly, they might not be happy in March.

"Not looking right now but keep me posted" = monthly-ish touchpoints with valuable content, no pressure.

"Actually, I've been thinking about moving" = schedule a call immediately, strike while the iron is warm.

No response = follow up once more in January, then let it rest. Desperation isn't a good look.

## Real Talk

Most of your pipeline won't respond. That's fine. The ones who do are either ready to move or close to it. You're playing a volume game with targeted, respectful outreach.

End-of-year check-ins work because you're meeting candidates when they're already thinking about their careers. You're not creating urgency, you're aligning with natural reflection periods.

Keep it professional, keep it valuable, keep it brief. You're maintaining relationships that might pay off in three months or three years.

Happy Thanksgiving. May your pipeline stay warm and your check-ins land at exactly the right moment.
