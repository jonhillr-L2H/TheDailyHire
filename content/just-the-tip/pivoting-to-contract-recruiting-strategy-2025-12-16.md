[70% of executives plan to hire more contract workers instead of permanent employees](https://recruiterflow.com/blog/recruitment-trends/), and if you're reading this, your leadership probably just told you the same thing.

Welcome to the contract economy. Here's how to adjust your recruiting strategy fast.

## Understand Why Leadership Is Making This Shift

[Companies are moving to contract hiring for budget flexibility, reduced commitment, and cost control](https://recruiterflow.com/blog/recruitment-trends/).

**What this means for you:**

**Faster hiring timelines:** [Contractors can start quickly without long notice periods or extensive onboarding](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Different sourcing channels:** [Contract talent lives in different places than perm candidates](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)—staffing agencies, freelance platforms, contractor networks.

**Different selling points:** You're not selling long-term career growth. [You're selling interesting projects, competitive rates, and flexibility](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

Understanding the "why" helps you adjust your pitch and process.

## Build Relationships With Staffing Agencies Fast

[If you're suddenly hiring 50% contractors, you can't do it all internally](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Find 3-5 reputable staffing agencies that specialize in your industry:**

- Get referrals from other recruiters or HR leaders
- Evaluate agencies based on time-to-fill, candidate quality, and pricing
- Negotiate rates upfront (standard contract fees are 30-50% markup on hourly rate)

[Build relationships with specific recruiters at these agencies](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025), not just the company. You want a go-to person who understands your needs and can move fast.

**Pro tip:** [Treat agency recruiters like partners, not vendors](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Give them clear feedback, pay invoices on time, and they'll prioritize your reqs over other clients.

## Tap Into Freelance and Contractor Platforms

[Contract talent hangs out in different places than perm candidates](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Where to find contractors:**

- **Toptal, Upwork, Fiverr** (freelance platforms for tech, creative, and business roles)
- **FlexJobs, We Work Remotely** (remote and flexible work job boards)
- **Linkedin** (search for people with "Open to contract work" or "Freelance" in their profiles)
- **Industry-specific contractor networks** (there are niche communities for almost every profession)

[Post contract roles on these platforms and actively source candidates who explicitly market themselves as contractors](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Adjust Your Candidate Pitch

[Selling a contract role is different from selling a perm role](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**What perm candidates care about:**
- Career growth and advancement
- Benefits and PTO
- Job security
- Company culture and long-term fit

**What contract candidates care about:**
- Hourly/daily rate
- Project duration and scope
- Flexibility and autonomy
- Interesting work and skill development

[Adjust your messaging:](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)

**Bad (perm pitch for contract role):** "We're looking for someone to join our team long-term and grow with the company."

**Good (contract pitch):** "We need an experienced [role] for a 6-month project with potential to extend. Competitive rate, fully remote, and you'll work directly with senior leadership on a high-impact initiative."

[Highlight the project, the rate, and the flexibility—not career ladders and benefits packages](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Master Contract-to-Hire Positioning

[Many companies are using contract-to-hire as a trial period](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Be upfront about it.

**How to position contract-to-hire:**

"This starts as a 3-6 month contract with strong potential to convert to full-time based on performance and business needs. [Many of our contractors have successfully transitioned to permanent roles](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)."

**What candidates want to know:**
- What's the conversion rate? (If it's 10%, be honest. If it's 70%, lead with that.)
- What determines conversion? (Performance? Budget approval? Manager discretion?)
- What would the perm role compensation look like?

[Don't oversell the perm conversion if it's unlikely](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Candidates will resent you when it doesn't happen.

## Streamline Your Contract Hiring Process

[Contract hiring needs to be faster than perm hiring](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Contractors are often available immediately and considering multiple opportunities.

**Compress your timeline:**

- **Resume review to phone screen:** 24-48 hours
- **Phone screen to interview:** 2-3 days
- **Interview to offer:** 1-2 days
- **Offer to start date:** 1-2 weeks max

[If you're taking 4 weeks to make a contract hire, you're losing candidates to faster-moving companies](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Simplify interviews:** [Contract roles don't need 4 rounds of interviews](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Skills assessment + 1-2 interviews should be enough.

## Understand Contract Worker Classification Rules

[Misclassifying employees as contractors is illegal and expensive](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Quick rule:** [If you control when, where, and how someone works, they're probably an employee, not a contractor](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Work with your legal and finance teams to ensure:**
- Contracts are properly structured
- Workers are classified correctly (W-2 contractor via agency vs. 1099 independent contractor)
- Compliance with state and federal labor laws

[You don't want to learn about misclassification when the Department of Labor shows up](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Build a Contractor Talent Pool

[If you're hiring contractors regularly, maintain an ongoing pool](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**How to build it:**

- [Track contractors who applied but weren't selected](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025) (they might be perfect for future projects)
- [Stay in touch with contractors whose projects ended well](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)
- Ask current contractors for referrals to their networks

[When a new contract role opens, reach out to your pool first](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Many contractors prefer working with companies they know.

## Set Clear Expectations With Hiring Managers

[Hiring managers used to perm hiring might not understand how contract hiring works differently](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Educate them:**

- [Contractors cost more per hour but no benefits overhead](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)
- [You can't expect long-term loyalty from someone on a 6-month contract](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)
- [The best contractors are usually juggling multiple clients—they won't be 100% dedicated to you](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)
- [Onboarding needs to be faster and more efficient](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)

[Set expectations upfront to avoid frustration later](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Negotiate Competitive Contract Rates

[Contract candidates care about rate more than almost anything else](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Research market rates:**
- Ask staffing agencies what they're seeing
- Check freelance platforms for similar roles
- [Talk to contractors in your network about their rates](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)

[If your rates are 20% below market, you won't attract quality talent](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Period.

**Budget reality:** [A contractor making $100/hour costs roughly the same as a $130K perm employee when you factor in benefits, PTO, and overhead](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Help finance understand this.

## Track Different Metrics

[Your recruiting metrics need to adjust for contract hiring](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Key metrics for contract hiring:**

- **Time-to-start:** (more important than time-to-offer since contractors start quickly)
- **Contract completion rate:** (what % of contractors finish their contracts successfully)
- **Conversion rate:** (for contract-to-hire roles, what % convert to perm)
- **Contractor satisfaction:** (will they work with you again on future projects?)
- **Cost-per-contract-hire:** (including agency fees)

[Don't compare contract hiring metrics directly to perm hiring metrics](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)—they're different hiring models with different success criteria.

## The Bottom Line

[The shift to contract hiring is happening whether you like it or not](https://recruiterflow.com/blog/recruitment-trends/). Your job is to adapt fast.

Build agency relationships, learn where contractors hang out, adjust your pitch, streamline your process, and educate hiring managers on how contract hiring works differently.

[The recruiters who figure this out will thrive in the contract economy](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). The ones who resist will struggle.

Your call.
