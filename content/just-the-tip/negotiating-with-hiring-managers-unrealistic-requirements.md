# How to Negotiate with Hiring Managers Who Have Unrealistic Requirements

Every recruiter has experienced this: the hiring manager who wants a senior engineer with 10 years of experience, expertise in 15 technologies, a PhD, fluent in three languages, willing to work for $80,000 in a major tech hub, available to start Monday.

"And they should be a culture fit."

Your internal response: "This person doesn't exist, and if they did, they sure as hell wouldn't work here for that salary."

Your actual response needs to be more diplomatic. Here's how to negotiate with hiring managers who have completely unrealistic requirements without destroying your relationship.

## Start with Data, Not Opinions

The biggest mistake recruiters make is arguing with hiring managers based on feelings. "I think that salary is too low" or "That seems like a lot to ask for" gets dismissed as recruiter opinion.

**Data, however, is much harder to argue with.**

**Pull market research before the conversation:**

- **Salary data:** Use [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi), [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com), [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com), or [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com) to show what similar roles actually pay in your market.

- **Sourcing data:** Run searches on LinkedIn to show how many candidates actually exist with their requirements. "I searched for [specific criteria] in [location] and found 12 people. Three are currently employed here, four work for direct competitors who won't let them leave, and the other five are being actively recruited by everyone."

- **Time-to-fill benchmarks:** Show [industry data from SHRM](https://www.shrm.org) or [LinkedIn talent insights](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions) on how long similar roles take to fill. "Roles with these requirements average 90-120 days to fill, and that's at market-rate compensation."

**The conversation structure:**

"I want to make sure we're set up for success on this hire. I did some market research, and I want to share what I found so we can make informed decisions together."

Then present the data visually if possible—screenshots of salary ranges, search results, benchmark reports. Make it undeniable.

[Research from Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources) shows that hiring managers who are shown objective market data adjust their requirements 68% of the time, compared to only 23% when recruiters make subjective appeals.

## Use the "Prioritization Framework" Approach

Most unrealistic job descriptions happen because hiring managers list everything they *might* want without distinguishing must-haves from nice-to-haves.

**Force prioritization using this framework:**

"Let's break these requirements into three categories:
1. **Must-haves:** The candidate can't do the job without these
2. **Strong preferences:** These would be great but we can train or supplement
3. **Nice-to-haves:** Bonus points but not essential"

Then go through each requirement and make them categorize it.

**Example conversation:**

Hiring Manager: "They need 8 years of Python experience."

You: "Is 8 years specifically a must-have, or is it more about being highly proficient? Could someone with 5 years of intensive Python experience plus strong fundamentals work?"

HM: "Well, I guess if they're really strong, 5 years could work."

You: "Great, so we'll put 'strong Python proficiency' as a must-have and '8+ years' as a strong preference. That opens up our candidate pool significantly."

**Why this works:**

It forces hiring managers to think critically about what's actually required versus what would be ideal in a fantasy world. Most of the time, the "must-have" list shrinks by 40-50% through this exercise.

One recruiter told me she had a hiring manager who initially listed 23 required qualifications. After the prioritization framework exercise, they had 6 actual must-haves and 17 nice-to-haves. The role filled in 3 weeks.

## Show Them the Trade-offs (The "Pick Two" Method)

When hiring managers insist on unrealistic combinations—like extensive experience, cutting-edge skills, and below-market salary—make the trade-offs explicit.

**The framework:**

"For this role, we can optimize for two of these three factors, but probably not all three:
1. **Experience level** (senior person with 10+ years)
2. **Salary budget** (below market rate)
3. **Speed to hire** (fill quickly)

Which two matter most?"

**Then walk through the scenarios:**

"If we keep the experience level and salary budget, we're looking at 4-6 months to fill because we need to find someone senior who's willing to take below-market comp. That's usually people leaving high-stress jobs for better work-life balance—they exist but are rare."

"If we increase the budget to market rate and keep the experience level, we can fill in 6-8 weeks."

"If we keep the salary budget and adjust to mid-level instead of senior, we can find good candidates in 4-6 weeks who we can develop into the senior role."

**Why this works:**

It reframes the conversation from "can we find this person?" to "what are we willing to adjust to get the right outcome?" Hiring managers usually haven't thought about these trade-offs explicitly.

[Studies on hiring manager behavior](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/hiring-managers) show that when trade-offs are made explicit, managers adjust requirements 73% of the time.

## Bring in External Validation

Sometimes hiring managers trust outside "experts" more than their own recruiters. Annoying but true.

**Leverage external sources:**

**Bring in your talent partners:** If you work with external recruiters or RPOs, have them back you up. "I spoke with [agency partner] who specializes in this space, and they confirmed that the salary is about 30% below market for this experience level."

**Reference recent similar searches:** "When we hired [similar role] six months ago, we had these same requirements and it took 5 months to fill. We ended up adjusting [specific requirement] and filled it in 3 weeks."

**Show competitor job postings:** Pull actual job descriptions from competitors for similar roles. "Here's what [respected company] is offering for this same role—$140K-$170K range, 5+ years required, not 10+."

**Loop in your head of talent/HR:** Sometimes the message lands better from leadership. "I flagged this with [head of talent] and they suggested we adjust the requirements based on what's worked for similar roles."

One corporate recruiter told me she keeps a "greatest hits" folder of unrealistic job reqs that eventually got adjusted, with time-to-fill data showing how long they took before adjustment. She shows this to stubborn hiring managers: "Here's what happened the last three times we tried this approach."

## The "Pilot Candidate" Strategy

Some hiring managers need to see the reality themselves before they'll adjust expectations.

**How this works:**

"Let me source a few candidates that match your current requirements and we can see what's available. I'll also source a few candidates who match a slightly adjusted profile. We can compare both groups and make an informed decision."

Then you strategically source:

**Group A:** The unicorns they asked for (you'll find 1-2 if you're lucky, and they'll be demanding $200K+)

**Group B:** Slightly adjusted requirements—maybe 6 years instead of 10, or missing one less-critical skill—and there are 20 qualified candidates at reasonable salary expectations

**Present both groups:** "Here are the two candidates I found matching your exact requirements. Both are currently making $180K and would need $200K+ to move. Here are eight candidates who have most of the requirements but [specific adjustment]. They're currently in the $120K-$140K range."

**Then let them decide:** Most hiring managers, when confronted with the actual market reality, will adjust their expectations.

[Recruiting effectiveness research](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources) shows that hiring managers who review actual candidate profiles adjust requirements 81% of the time versus 45% for those who only discuss requirements theoretically.

## When to Push Back Hard

Sometimes you need to be more direct, especially when requirements are literally impossible or potentially discriminatory.

**Red flag requirements that need immediate pushback:**

**Age proxies:** "Recent grad" or "digital native" or "10-15 years max experience" can be age discrimination. Push back with: "Legal flagged language that could be interpreted as age-related. Let's focus on skills and capabilities instead."

**Impossible combinations:** "Entry-level role requiring 5 years of experience" or "junior salary for senior role." Be direct: "This combination doesn't exist in the market. We need to either adjust the level or the compensation."

**Discriminatory culture fit:** "Must be a culture fit" often means "must look/act like current team." Ask: "What specific behaviors and working styles are you looking for?" to get them to articulate non-discriminatory criteria.

**Irrelevant requirements:** "Must have [specific degree]" when the degree isn't actually relevant to job performance. "What's the rationale for requiring this degree? I want to make sure we're not inadvertently excluding qualified candidates."

According to [EEOC guidance](https://www.eeoc.gov), recruiters have a responsibility to flag potentially discriminatory requirements. It's not just good practice—it's legal obligation.

## Build Long-term Credibility

The hiring managers who trust you most are the ones who've seen you be right before.

**Track your predictions:** When a hiring manager insists on unrealistic requirements and you predict it'll take 90 days to fill, document it. When it actually takes 94 days, bring it up (diplomatically) next time: "Remember the [role] search? We had similar requirements and it took 3 months. I want to avoid that this time if possible."

**Celebrate successful adjustments:** When a hiring manager adjusts requirements and you fill the role quickly with a great candidate, make sure they know. "Thanks for being flexible on [requirement]—it made all the difference in finding [candidate] quickly."

**Share successful hires:** When candidates hired with adjusted requirements become top performers, remind the hiring manager. "Remember we adjusted the years of experience requirement for [employee]? They just [impressive achievement]. Really glad we focused on potential rather than years."

This builds trust over time. Eventually, hiring managers start trusting your market expertise instead of fighting you on every requirement.

## What Good Looks Like

A tech recruiter I know had a hiring manager who wanted a senior machine learning engineer with 8+ years of experience, PhD preferred, for $110,000 in San Francisco.

She pulled data showing the market rate was $180K-$240K. She ran LinkedIn searches showing 7 total candidates matching those requirements in SF, all currently employed at Google, Meta, or well-funded startups.

She prioritized requirements with the hiring manager and identified that the PhD was a nice-to-have, and 5+ years of strong ML experience would work.

She showed them salary data and said: "We can find someone with 5+ years and strong ML skills for $160K-$180K and fill this in 6-8 weeks. Or we can keep the current requirements and I honestly can't predict when we'll fill it—possibly never at this budget."

The hiring manager adjusted to 5+ years, no PhD required, and approved $170K. Role filled in 5 weeks with a candidate who's now a top performer.

## The Bottom Line

Negotiating with unrealistic hiring managers isn't about winning arguments—it's about partnering to achieve their actual business goal (hiring a great person quickly).

The tactics that work:

1. **Lead with data**, not opinions
2. **Force prioritization** to separate must-haves from wish-list items
3. **Make trade-offs explicit** so they understand the consequences
4. **Bring in external validation** when your voice isn't enough
5. **Show them real candidates** to demonstrate market reality
6. **Push back hard** on impossible or discriminatory requirements
7. **Build long-term credibility** through tracking and celebrating wins

Most hiring managers aren't trying to be difficult—they just don't know what they don't know about the talent market. Your job is to educate them without making them feel stupid, show them reality without being condescending, and guide them to requirements that actually work.

Do this well, and you'll stop wasting months chasing unicorns and start filling roles with great candidates who actually exist.

And maybe, just maybe, your hiring managers will start trusting you when you say something is unrealistic.

Stranger things have happened.
