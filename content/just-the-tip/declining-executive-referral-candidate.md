The CEO just emailed you: "My friend's daughter is looking for a role. I forwarded her resume. Let's get her in for interviews."

You review the resume. She has zero relevant experience. The role requires 5+ years. She has 6 months. This is a disaster waiting to happen.

You have two options: hire an unqualified person to appease an executive, or decline the referral and potentially damage your relationship with leadership.

Here's how to navigate this situation without torpedoing your career.

## Why This Situation Is So Dangerous

Executive referrals create impossible dynamics:

**Rejecting feels like a personal insult**: The executive vouched for this person. Saying "they're not qualified" feels like saying "your judgment is terrible."

**You don't know the relationship**: Is this their best friend's kid? A casual acquaintance? The strength of the relationship determines how much capital they'll spend pushing the candidate.

**Political consequences are real**: Executives have power. They control budgets, promotions, and your continued employment. Pissing them off has consequences.

**Everyone is watching**: How you handle this reveals whether you have integrity or fold under pressure. Your team, hiring managers, and other candidates are all paying attention.

**The candidate might be good**: Sometimes executive referrals are genuinely qualified. Don't assume they're terrible just because they were referred.

## Step 1: Evaluate The Candidate Objectively First

Before you do anything political, assess the candidate fairly:

**Review the resume without bias**: Pretend you don't know who referred them. Are they qualified? Close but not quite? Completely unqualified?

**Check LinkedIn and online presence**: Maybe the resume doesn't tell the full story. Do they have relevant projects, skills, or experience not listed?

**Consider adjacent skills**: Do they have transferable skills that could work even if their background isn't a perfect match?

**Ask yourself: Would you interview this person if they applied cold?** Be honest. If the answer is yes, interview them. If no, proceed to the political strategy.

## Step 2: Acknowledge The Referral Immediately

Don't ignore the email. Respond quickly:

**Bad response:**
[No response, or delayed response]

**Good response:**
"Thanks for the referral! I'll review [Candidate's] background and reach out to discuss next steps."

**Why this works**: You're acknowledging the referral without committing to anything. You're buying yourself time to strategize.

## Step 3: Understand The Executive's Expectations

Before you reject the candidate, figure out what the executive actually wants:

**Option A: They want the person hired, period.**
This is worst-case. You'll need maximum diplomacy.

**Option B: They want the person to get a fair shot.**
This is manageable. A fair interview process that leads to a no is acceptable.

**Option C: They're doing a favor and don't really care.**
Best case. A quick "We reviewed but don't have a fit right now" will work.

**How to figure out which it is:**

Reply with: "I'd love to learn more about [Candidate's] background and what type of role might be a good fit. Do you have a few minutes to chat?"

In that conversation, listen for:
- "I really think they'd be great here" (Option A—pressure to hire)
- "Just wanted to make sure they get considered" (Option B—fair process expected)
- "Yeah, just helping them out with their search" (Option C—low stakes)

## Step 4: The Diplomatic Rejection Strategy

If the candidate genuinely isn't qualified and you need to decline, here's the approach:

**Step 4A: Offer an informational interview or coffee chat**

"I reviewed [Candidate's] background. They have some interesting experience, but the [specific role] requires [specific qualifications] they don't currently have. I'd be happy to set up a 30-minute informational chat to discuss their career goals and see if there are other opportunities at [Company] that might be a better fit."

**Why this works:**
- You're not saying "no" outright
- You're showing you took it seriously
- You're offering something valuable (career advice)
- You're leaving the door open for other roles

**Step 4B: Provide specific, objective feedback**

"After reviewing [Candidate's] background, the challenge is that the [Role] requires [X years experience in Y], and [Candidate] is currently focused on [Different Area]. Based on our hiring criteria, it wouldn't be a strong match right now."

**Why this works:**
- You're citing objective criteria, not opinion
- You're showing you actually reviewed the candidate
- You're making it about fit, not competence

**Step 4C: Suggest an alternative path**

"I don't think the [Senior Role] is the right fit given where [Candidate] is in their career, but we have [Entry-Level Role or Internship] openings that could be a great starting point if they're interested."

**Why this works:**
- You're offering a solution
- You're not rejecting them outright
- You're showing flexibility

## Step 5: What To Do If The Executive Pushes Back

Sometimes you'll decline diplomatically and the executive will push harder:

**"I really think you should interview them anyway."**

Response: "Absolutely, I'm happy to set up an interview. I want to set proper expectations that based on our role requirements, this would be a developmental hire rather than someone who meets our standard criteria. If you're comfortable with that, we can proceed."

**Translation**: I'll interview them, but I'm documenting that you're asking me to lower the bar.

**"Can't we make an exception?"**

Response: "I want to be thoughtful about this. If we hire [Candidate] for a role they're not fully qualified for, I'm concerned about setting them up for failure. Would you be open to discussing a modified role scope or development plan that would set them up for success?"

**Translation**: I'll do it, but we're going to do it properly with a plan.

**"I've seen their work and they're really sharp."**

Response: "That's great to hear. Would you be comfortable if I had [Hiring Manager] conduct a working session or case study interview to assess their skills in a practical context? That way we can validate the fit."

**Translation**: Let's get objective data instead of relying on your personal opinion.

## Step 6: Loop In Your Manager or HR

Don't handle this alone. Involve your manager or HR business partner:

"I received a referral from [Executive] for a candidate who doesn't meet the role requirements. I'm planning to [your strategy]. Wanted to make sure you're aware and aligned on the approach."

**Why this is critical:**
- You're protecting yourself
- You're getting organizational support
- You're documenting the situation
- You're ensuring consistency with company policy

If your manager says "Just interview them to make [Executive] happy," you have clear direction. If they say "Handle this by the book," you have backing to decline.

## Step 7: The Rejection Email (When You Have To Send It)

If you ultimately need to reject the candidate, here's the template:

**Subject:** Following Up on [Candidate Name]

**Body:**
"Hi [Executive],

I wanted to follow up on [Candidate Name]. I reviewed their background and had a chance to discuss with [Hiring Manager/Team]. While they have [something positive and genuine], the [Role] requires [specific criteria] that doesn't align with their current experience level.

I'd be happy to stay in touch with [Candidate] and reach out if we have roles that are a better match for their background. I also offered to connect them with [relevant person/resource] if they're interested in [related area].

Thanks for thinking of us for [Candidate]. I appreciate you keeping [Company] in mind for strong talent."

**Why this works:**
- You're direct but diplomatic
- You're citing objective criteria
- You're offering to stay in touch (leaves the door open)
- You're thanking them for the referral (ends on a positive note)

## What To Do If They Hire The Unqualified Candidate Anyway

Sometimes executives override your objections and hire the person anyway. When that happens:

**Document everything**: Your concerns, the qualifications gap, the conversations. CYA.

**Set clear expectations with the candidate**: "Here's what success looks like in this role. Here's the support we'll provide. Here are the milestones we'll be tracking."

**Create a development plan**: If they're underqualified, build a structured plan to close the gaps. Maybe they'll surprise you.

**Be fair**: Don't sabotage them because you didn't want them hired. They deserve a real shot.

**Prepare for failure**: Have a plan for what happens if they don't work out. Document performance issues objectively so you can exit them if necessary.

## The Bottom Line

Executive referrals are political minefields. Hire unqualified candidates and you destroy your hiring standards. Reject them carelessly and you damage critical relationships.

**The strategy:**
- Evaluate objectively first—don't assume they're unqualified
- Acknowledge the referral immediately
- Understand what the executive actually wants
- Provide diplomatic, objective feedback if declining
- Offer alternatives (informational interviews, different roles)
- Loop in your manager or HR for support
- Document everything

Most executives aren't trying to force bad hires. They're trying to help someone they care about. If you handle it professionally, show you took it seriously, and provide thoughtful feedback, most will respect your decision.

And if they don't? That's when you document, involve HR, and update your resume.

**The Fast Version:**
- Evaluate the candidate objectively before getting political
- Respond quickly to acknowledge the referral
- Figure out what the executive actually expects
- Decline diplomatically with objective criteria
- Offer alternatives like informational interviews or other roles
- Loop in your manager or HR for support
- Document everything
- If they're hired anyway despite being unqualified, set clear expectations and create a development plan
