Let me tell you something I learned after 30 years in this business: [companies almost never lead with their best offer](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/initial-salary-offers-room-negotiate). They leave room to negotiate because they expect you to negotiate. And if you don't? Well, honey, that's money left on the table.

## The Number One Rule

**Never accept the first offer immediately.** Even if it's good. Even if it's exactly what you wanted. [Take 24-48 hours to "think it over"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/salary-negotiation-timing). This does two things:

1. Shows you're thoughtful and not desperate
2. [Gives you time to research if the offer is actually competitive](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm)

I've seen people leave $10K-20K on the table by saying yes too fast. Don't be that person.

## The Magic Phrase

When they give you the offer, here's what you say: ["Thank you so much for the offer. I'm very excited about the opportunity. Can I have until [specific date] to review everything and get back to you?"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/asking-time-review-offer)

Notice what you didn't say: "I need to negotiate" or "That's too low." You're just asking for time. Professional, reasonable, non-confrontational.

## Do Your Homework

[Use sites like Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, and Payscale to research what others in similar roles actually make](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/salary-negotiation-data/). Factor in:
- Your experience level
- Company size and funding stage
- Geographic location (even for remote roles)
- Industry standards

[If their offer is below the 50th percentile for your role, you've got strong negotiating ground](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/salary-benchmarking-competitive-offers).

## The Counter-Offer Formula

Here's how to actually counter: ["I'm really excited about this role. Based on my research of market rates for this position and my X years of experience in [specific relevant skills], I was hoping we could discuss a salary in the range of $Y-Z."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/salary-counter-offer-script)

Then stop talking. [Let them respond](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/negotiation-silence-power). The silence will be uncomfortable. That's fine. They need to make the next move.

## Beyond Base Salary

If they won't budge on salary, [negotiate everything else](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/total-compensation-negotiation-tactics):

- **Signing bonus:** One-time payment that doesn't affect their salary budget
- **Stock options or equity:** [Especially valuable at startups or pre-IPO companies](https://www.levels.fyi/equity-calculator/)
- **Extra PTO:** Usually easier for them to approve than more money
- **Professional development budget:** Conferences, courses, certifications
- **Remote work flexibility:** [If hybrid is standard, can you do full remote?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/negotiating-remote-work-arrangement)
- **Title bump:** [Sometimes a better title helps with future job searches](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/job-title-negotiation)
- **Earlier performance review:** "Can we do a 90-day review instead of annual?"

[I've seen people get an extra $5K signing bonus, 3 additional PTO days, and a $2K learning budget when salary was "final](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/creative-compensation-negotiations)." Everything is negotiable if you ask.

## What Not to Do

**Don't lie about other offers.** [Companies sometimes call your bluff](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/competing-offers-verification). If you don't have another offer, don't invent one.

**Don't make it personal.** "I need more money because my rent went up" is not compelling. [Frame it around your value to the company](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/salary-negotiation-value-based).

**Don't negotiate via email if you can help it.** [Phone or video call allows for actual conversation and reading reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/negotiation-communication-method). Email makes it too easy for them to just say no.

**Don't apologize for negotiating.** [You're not being difficult, you're being professional](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/confidence-salary-negotiation). They expect it.

## The Reality Check

Here's something nobody tells you: [if a company rescinds an offer because you negotiated respectfully, you dodged a bullet](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/rescinded-offers-negotiation-red-flag). That's not a place you want to work.

Good companies respect candidates who know their worth. [The worst thing that happens when you negotiate? They say no and keep the original offer](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/negotiation-risks-reality). Which is exactly where you'd be if you didn't ask.

Bottom line: [Companies budget for negotiations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/salary-offer-negotiation-room-built-in). If you don't negotiate, you're giving them a discount on your talent. And honey, you're not on sale.

Ask for what you're worth. You'll be surprised how often you get it.
