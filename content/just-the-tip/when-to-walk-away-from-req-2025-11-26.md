Some requisitions are unfillable. Not "challenging" or "taking longer than expected." Actually impossible given the constraints. Your job includes recognizing this and having the uncomfortable conversation before you waste months trying.

## Signs a Req Is Unfillable

The compensation is 30-40% below market for the experience required. You've sent market data. They don't care. They "just need someone willing to take less." Cool, you need a unicorn who doesn't understand their value.

The requirements are contradictory. They want a senior-level expert with 10 years of experience willing to accept a junior title and compensation. They want remote flexibility but require in-office presence four days a week. Math isn't mathing.

You've submitted qualified candidates and they've been rejected for arbitrary reasons. "Cultural fit" with no specifics, "not quite right" after multiple interviews, moving goalposts on requirements. They don't actually know what they want.

The hiring manager ghosts scheduling, cancels interviews repeatedly, or clearly isn't prioritizing the hire. If THEY don't care, you're spinning wheels.

## Do the Math First

Before the conversation, document everything. How many candidates sourced, how many submitted, how many interviewed, rejection reasons, time invested. Data makes your case stronger than feelings.

Calculate opportunity cost. Hours spent on this unfillable req could have been spent filling actual hirable roles. Show the business impact, not just your frustration.

Research market reality. Salary surveys, competitor job postings, talent availability in their required location/skillset. Come prepared with proof, not opinions.

## Having the Conversation

Start collaborative, not accusatory: "I want to talk about the [Job Title] role. I've been working on it for [X weeks/months] and I'm concerned we need to adjust our approach."

Present the data: "I've sourced 47 candidates, submitted 8 qualified ones, and we've rejected all of them. The consistent feedback is compensation/requirements/timeline. Here's the market data showing why."

Offer solutions, not just problems: "We have a few options. We can increase the budget to competitive range, adjust the requirements to match the compensation, extend the search timeline significantly, or consider alternative approaches like contract-to-hire."

## Frame It as Partnership

"I want to fill this role as much as you do. But with the current parameters, we're setting ourselves up for failure. Let's figure out what's actually achievable."

Not: "This req is impossible and you're being unreasonable."

Even if that's true. Especially if that's true.

## The Firm Boundary

If they won't adjust unrealistic expectations and won't acknowledge market reality, you have options depending on your role:

Internal recruiter: "I need to prioritize reqs that are fillable within reasonable timelines. I'm going to reduce time on this role and focus on [other roles] unless we can adjust the parameters."

Agency recruiter: "I don't think I can deliver results given these constraints. I'd rather be honest now than waste both our time."

## When to Actually Walk Away

They're hostile to market data and refuse to adjust despite evidence. They're not serious about hiring, they're serious about proving they're right.

They've made it clear the role isn't actually a priority but expect you to keep working it. Your time is finite.

The role is fillable but the hiring manager is impossible to work with and leadership won't intervene. Sometimes the problem isn't the req, it's the person.

You've lost credibility with candidates because of this req (lowball offers, bad interview experiences, etc). Protecting your reputation matters.

## The Professional Exit

"After [X months] and significant effort, I don't believe I can successfully fill this role given the current constraints. I recommend either adjusting the parameters or finding a recruiter who might have different networks/approaches. I'm happy to help transition any candidates I've engaged."

Firm, professional, not burning bridges. You gave it a real shot, documented the issues, offered solutions, and they chose not to adjust. That's on them.

## What Happens Next

Best case: they realize you're serious and actually adjust the req to be fillable. You fill it successfully and build credibility.

Likely case: they thank you for your time and nothing changes. They'll either hire someone else to try (who will hit the same walls) or leave the role open indefinitely.

Worst case: they're annoyed but you've protected your time and sanity. You can't fill impossible roles and trying just damages your track record.

## Real Talk

Walking away from reqs feels scary, especially if you're worried about relationships or revenue. But working impossible reqs is worse. You're investing time that could fill actual jobs, damaging candidate relationships with lowball offers, and setting yourself up to be blamed for their unrealistic expectations.

Your job is to fill fillable roles, not perform miracles. Know the difference and have the backbone to say so.

Some battles aren't worth fighting. Some reqs aren't worth filling. Walk away strategically and protect your sanity.

You'll sleep better. Promise.
