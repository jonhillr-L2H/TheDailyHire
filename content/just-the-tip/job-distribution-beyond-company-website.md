Here's a reality check: [posting your job openings only on your company careers page is like opening a store in the middle of nowhere and wondering why nobody's shopping](https://www.ere.net/job-distribution-strategy-traffic-reality/). Unless you're Google or Nike, candidates aren't regularly checking your careers page hoping you posted something interesting.

[Research shows that 73% of job seekers discover opportunities through job boards and aggregators, not company websites](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/job-seeker-discovery-channels-2025). If you're not distributing your job postings across multiple high-traffic platforms, you're missing the majority of potential candidates.

I've seen companies sit on open roles for months, wondering why they're not getting applicants, when the answer is simple: nobody knows the jobs exist. You're fishing in a puddle when you should be fishing in an ocean.

Here's the multi-channel job distribution strategy that actually fills roles.

## Why Your Careers Page Alone Doesn't Work

[Unless you're a household-name employer, your careers page traffic is probably abysmal](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/careers-page-traffic-reality-check). Let's be honest about the numbers:

**Average company careers page traffic:** [100-500 monthly visitors for small/mid-size companies, 1,000-5,000 for larger companies](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/careers-page-traffic-benchmarks).

**Indeed monthly traffic:** [250+ million unique visitors](https://www.indeed.com/about).

**LinkedIn monthly traffic:** [310+ million monthly active users in the US alone](https://www.linkedin.com/about-us/).

Your careers page is one tiny corner of the internet. [The vast majority of job seekers start their search on aggregators and job boards where they can browse thousands of opportunities in one place](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/job-search-behavior-platform-usage-2025/).

[Relying solely on your careers page means you're only reaching candidates who already know about your company and are motivated enough to seek you out](https://www.ere.net/passive-candidate-discovery-job-boards). You're missing passive candidates, people exploring new opportunities, and anyone who hasn't heard of your organization.

## The Multi-Channel Distribution Framework

[Effective job distribution requires posting on multiple high-traffic platforms where candidates actively search](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/job-distribution-channels-effectiveness-2025). Here's the framework:

### Tier 1: Major Job Boards (Non-Negotiable)

These platforms have massive traffic and should be your foundation:

**Indeed:** [The largest job board globally, reaching 250+ million candidates monthly](https://www.indeed.com/hire/recruiting-resources). Offers free basic posting with optional sponsored upgrades. [Companies posting on Indeed see 3-5x more applications than posting on careers pages alone](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indeed-posting-application-rate-increase).

**LinkedIn Jobs:** [310+ million US professionals actively using LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/platform-stats/linkedin-job-seeker-statistics). Particularly strong for professional, white-collar, and mid-to-senior roles. Paid posting required but highly effective for quality candidates.

**Glassdoor:** [Attracts candidates researching company culture and reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/). Strong for employer branding-conscious candidates who care about reputation. Free posting available with Glassdoor profile.

**ZipRecruiter:** [Distributes your job to 100+ additional job sites automatically](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/post-a-job). Good for broad reach across multiple platforms without manual posting.

[Companies using all four of these platforms see 10-15x more applications than posting on careers pages alone](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/job-board-roi-application-volume).

### Tier 2: Niche Platforms (Industry-Specific)

[Generic job boards work for most roles, but niche platforms reach specialized talent more effectively](https://www.ere.net/niche-job-boards-specialized-talent-acquisition).

**Tech roles:**
- [Stack Overflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) - Developers actively on the platform
- [GitHub Jobs](https://jobs.github.com/) - Engineers with public portfolios
- [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs) - Startup and tech-focused candidates
- [Dice](https://www.dice.com/) - IT and tech professionals

**Creative roles:**
- [Behance](https://www.behance.net/joblist) - Designers showcasing portfolios
- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/jobs) - UI/UX designers
- [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) - Remote creative professionals

**Healthcare:**
- [Health eCareers](https://www.healthecareers.com/)
- [Nurse.com](https://www.nurse.com/jobs)

**Finance:**
- [eFinancialCareers](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/)

[Niche platforms have lower traffic but higher candidate quality for specialized roles](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/niche-job-board-candidate-quality). [Posting on 1-2 niche platforms alongside major boards increases quality applications by 40%](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/niche-vs-general-job-boards-quality).

### Tier 3: Social Media and Community Platforms

[Modern candidates discover jobs through social media, not just job boards](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/social-media-job-discovery-trends-2025).

**LinkedIn organic posts:** [Share your job postings as regular LinkedIn updates, not just through LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/organic-linkedin-job-promotion). Ask employees to share. [Organic reach can drive 20-30% additional applications at zero cost](https://www.ere.net/linkedin-organic-job-posting-reach).

**Twitter/X:** For tech, media, and creative roles, [Twitter has active talent communities](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/twitter-recruiting-effectiveness-creative-tech-roles). Use relevant hashtags (#hiring, #jobsearch, industry-specific tags).

**Reddit:** [Subreddits like r/forhire, r/jobbit, and industry-specific communities are underutilized for recruiting](https://www.ere.net/reddit-recruiting-niche-communities). Follow community rules carefully.

**Slack and Discord communities:** [Many industries have professional Slack/Discord groups with jobs channels](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/community-based-recruiting-slack-discord). Marketing, SaaS, engineering, and design communities are particularly active.

**Facebook Groups:** [Local job groups and industry-specific Facebook communities can be effective for certain roles](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/facebook-recruiting-local-communities).

[Multi-platform social distribution adds 15-25% more applications without additional cost](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/social-media-job-distribution-roi).

### Tier 4: Employee Networks and Referrals

[Your employees' networks are one of the highest-quality candidate sources](https://www.ere.net/employee-referrals-quality-of-hire-data).

**Employee referral sharing:** [Make it easy for employees to share job postings on their social networks](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/employee-social-sharing-job-postings). Provide pre-written copy they can customize.

**Referral incentives:** [Offer meaningful bonuses ($1,000-$5,000) for successful referrals](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/employee-referral-bonus-effectiveness). [Referrals have 45% retention rates after one year vs. 25% for job board hires](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/employee-referral-program-roi).

**Network tap-ins:** [Ask employees to share in relevant professional groups they're part of](https://www.ere.net/employee-network-recruiting-underutilized-channel)—alumni networks, professional associations, community groups.

[Employee-driven distribution increases applications by 10-20% and improves quality significantly](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/employee-referral-impact-application-quality-volume).

## How to Execute Multi-Channel Distribution Efficiently

"But this sounds like a ton of work!" [It is, if you're manually posting to 10+ platforms for every role](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/manual-job-distribution-time-cost). That's why you need systems:

**Use job distribution tools:** [Platforms like ZipRecruiter, Broadbean, or your ATS's built-in distribution automatically post to multiple sites](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/job-distribution-automation-tools).

**Create posting templates:** [Standardize your job posting format so you can quickly adapt it for different platforms](https://www.ere.net/job-posting-templates-efficiency).

**Schedule social promotion:** [Use tools like Buffer or Hootsuite to schedule social posts promoting your jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/social-media-scheduling-recruiting).

**Track which channels work:** [Use UTM parameters or ATS source tracking to see which platforms drive applications and hires](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-source-tracking-roi-analysis). Double down on what works.

[Automated distribution takes 15-30 minutes per role vs. 2-3 hours for manual posting](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/recruiting-automation-time-savings-distribution).

## Platform-Specific Best Practices

Not all platforms work the same way. [Optimize for each channel](https://www.ere.net/job-board-optimization-platform-specific-strategies):

**Indeed:**
- [Sponsor high-priority roles for visibility](https://www.indeed.com/hire/recruiting-resources/sponsored-jobs)
- Use clear, keyword-rich job titles
- Include salary ranges (Indeed prioritizes transparent postings)

**LinkedIn:**
- [Promote jobs organically by posting from your company page](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/linkedin-company-page-job-promotion)
- Encourage employees to engage and share
- Use LinkedIn Recruiter to proactively reach passive candidates

**Niche boards:**
- [Tailor language and emphasize platform-relevant skills](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/niche-job-board-posting-optimization)
- For Stack Overflow, emphasize tech stack and engineering culture
- For creative boards, highlight portfolio expectations and design tools

**Social media:**
- [Keep it conversational, not corporate](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/social-media-job-posting-tone-engagement)
- Include visuals (team photos, office images, project examples)
- Respond to comments and questions promptly

## How to Measure Distribution Effectiveness

[Track metrics by source to understand ROI](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/recruiting-source-effectiveness-measurement):

**Applications per source:** How many applicants come from each platform?

**Quality of applications:** [What percentage of applicants from each source meet basic qualifications?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/source-quality-metrics-recruiting)

**Cost per application:** [Free vs. paid sources—what's your cost per qualified applicant?](https://www.ere.net/cost-per-application-recruiting-source-analysis)

**Hires per source:** [Which platforms actually result in hires, not just applications?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/source-of-hire-metrics-analysis-2025)

[Data-driven distribution means investing in high-ROI channels and cutting low-performers](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/recruiting-analytics-optimization).

## Common Distribution Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Posting once and forgetting:** [Jobs get buried quickly on boards. Refresh and repost every 2-3 weeks if not filled](https://www.ere.net/job-posting-refresh-strategy-visibility).

**Mistake 2: Using identical copy everywhere:** [Tailor language for platform audiences. LinkedIn professionals vs. Reddit community members respond to different tones](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/platform-specific-job-posting-language).

**Mistake 3: Ignoring free platforms:** [You don't need to pay for every job board. Many free platforms drive solid results](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/free-job-boards-effectiveness-2025).

**Mistake 4: Not tracking sources:** [If you don't know which platforms work, you're wasting time and money](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/recruiting-source-tracking-importance).

**Mistake 5: Distribution without employer branding:** [If your Glassdoor reviews are terrible or your LinkedIn page is inactive, distribution won't help](https://www.ere.net/employer-brand-job-distribution-relationship). Fix your brand first.

## The Bottom Line

[Posting jobs only on your careers page is like shouting into the void](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/careers-page-only-posting-ineffective). [73% of candidates discover jobs through boards and aggregators, not company websites](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/job-seeker-discovery-channels-2025).

[Multi-channel distribution—major job boards, niche platforms, social media, and employee networks—increases application volume by 10-15x and improves candidate quality](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/multi-channel-job-distribution-effectiveness).

Use automation tools to post efficiently. Track sources to optimize investment. Tailor messaging by platform. And for the love of all that is holy, stop expecting candidates to magically find your careers page.

Go where candidates are. That's the tip.
