You find the perfect candidate on LinkedIn. You send them a message:

*"Hi [Name]! I came across your profile and was impressed by your experience. We have an exciting opportunity that might be a great fit. Would you be open to a quick chat?"*

They don't respond.

You send it to 50 more people. 48 don't respond. The 2 who do respond say "not interested."

**Here's why your LinkedIn outreach isn't working:** You sound exactly like every other recruiter.

Passive candidates get 10-20 recruiter messages per week. [Most delete them without reading past the first sentence](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/recruiting-strategy/passive-candidate-response-rates-2025).

Here's how to write outreach that actually gets responses.

## Why Most LinkedIn Recruiter Messages Fail

**The generic recruiter message:**

> Hi Sarah!
>
> I came across your profile and was impressed by your experience in software engineering. We have an exciting opportunity at [Company] that could be a great fit for your background.
>
> Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to learn more?
>
> Looking forward to connecting!
> [Your Name]

**Why this fails:**

1. **It's obviously a template.** "I came across your profile" = "I searched for keywords and you came up."
2. **It's vague.** "Exciting opportunity" and "great fit" mean nothing.
3. **It's recruiter-focused.** "Would you be open to a call?" = "Give me your time so I can pitch you."
4. **There's no reason to care.** What's in it for them?

[Generic messages have a 2-5% response rate](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/recruiting-strategy/passive-candidate-response-rates-2025). Personalized, specific messages get 20-40% response rates.

## The Formula For LinkedIn Messages That Actually Work

**Good passive candidate outreach has four elements:**

1. **Personalization** (prove you actually looked at their profile)
2. **Specificity** (say what the role is, don't make them guess)
3. **Value proposition** (why should they care?)
4. **Low-pressure ask** (don't demand a call immediately)

### Example: Generic vs. Good

**Generic (2% response rate):**

> Hi James,
>
> I came across your profile and was impressed by your experience. We're hiring a Senior Product Manager and I think you'd be a great fit. Would you be open to a quick call?

**Good (30% response rate):**

> Hi James,
>
> I saw you recently launched the new checkout flow at [Company]—the post you shared about reducing cart abandonment by 18% was great. Really smart approach to the mobile UX problem.
>
> I'm recruiting for a Senior Product Manager role at [Company], focused on building payment experiences for SMB customers. The team is tackling similar conversion challenges at a different scale (we're processing $500M annually and aiming to double that).
>
> Not sure if you're open to exploring new opportunities, but I thought the problem space might be interesting given your checkout work. If you're curious, I'm happy to share more about the role and team.
>
> Either way, hope the new feature launch goes well!
>
> [Your Name]

**Why this works:**

- **Personalization:** References specific work (checkout flow, cart abandonment metric)
- **Specificity:** Says exactly what the role is (Senior PM, payment experiences, SMB customers)
- **Value proposition:** Explains why it might be interesting (similar problems at bigger scale)
- **Low-pressure:** "Not sure if you're open" and "either way" = no pressure

[Personalized messages get 7x higher response rates than generic templates](https://www.lever.co/blog/linkedin-outreach-personalization-impact/).

## How To Personalize At Scale (Without Spending Hours Per Message)

"But I don't have time to write custom messages for 50 people!"

You don't need to spend 20 minutes per message. You need to spend 2-3 minutes finding one specific, relevant detail.

### Quick personalization sources:

**1. Recent LinkedIn posts or comments**

Check their activity. Did they post, comment, or share something recently? Reference it.

**Example:**
> "Saw your comment on the AI in product management thread—agreed that most teams are over-indexing on AI features without solving real customer problems."

**2. Recent job changes or promotions**

If they recently started a new role, don't recruit them (they just started). If they got promoted 6+ months ago, congratulate them and reference it.

**Example:**
> "Congrats on the promotion to Senior Engineer—looks like you've been leading the infrastructure migration project."

**3. Projects or products they've worked on**

Check their experience section. What did they actually build? Reference something specific.

**Example:**
> "I saw you were one of the early engineers on [Product]—I've used it for years and always appreciated how intuitive the onboarding flow is."

**4. Shared connections or background**

Went to the same school? Worked at the same company (different times)? Mention it.

**Example:**
> "I saw you also worked at [Company]—I was there 2018-2020 on the platform team. I'm guessing you have strong feelings about the legacy codebase."

[Even one sentence of genuine personalization increases response rates dramatically](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiter-message-personalization-strategies/).

## The "Problem-First" Approach (For Senior/Passive Candidates)

Senior passive candidates don't care about "exciting opportunities." They care about interesting problems.

**Instead of:** "We're hiring a Senior Engineer."

**Try:** "We're rebuilding our API infrastructure to handle 10x scale. Looking for an engineer who's solved distributed systems problems at scale."

**Instead of:** "We have a great culture and benefits."

**Try:** "We're a 12-person team building dev tools for infrastructure engineers. Lots of technical autonomy, minimal meetings."

**Why this works:** [Senior candidates are motivated by problems, not perks](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiting-senior-engineers-messaging/).

**Example: Problem-first message**

> Hi Maria,
>
> I saw you led the database migration at [Company]—moving from Postgres to distributed Cassandra at that scale is no joke. I'm guessing you learned some painful lessons about data consistency.
>
> I'm working on a similar problem at [Company]. We're migrating a monolith database (8TB, 50M users) to a distributed architecture. Looking for an engineer who's been through this before and can help us avoid the landmines.
>
> Not sure if you're open to new opportunities, but I thought the problem might be interesting. Happy to share more if you're curious.
>
> [Your Name]

[Problem-first messages get 40%+ response rates from senior engineers](https://www.lever.co/blog/engineering-recruiting-problem-first-messaging/).

## The "No-Pressure" Close

Don't end with: "Are you available for a call this week?"

**That's high-pressure. Passive candidates will ignore it.**

Instead, use low-pressure closes:

✅ "If you're curious, I'm happy to share more."

✅ "Not sure if this is relevant for you, but thought I'd reach out."

✅ "No pressure if you're not interested—just thought the role might be a fit."

✅ "Let me know if you'd like to hear more—or feel free to ignore if timing isn't right."

[Low-pressure closes double response rates compared to "are you available for a call?" closes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-message-closing-strategies/).

## What To Do When They Respond

When a passive candidate responds, **don't immediately try to schedule a call.**

**Bad response:**

> Great to hear from you! When are you available for a quick call this week?

**Good response:**

> Awesome! Here's a bit more detail about the role: [2-3 sentence summary]. The team is [brief context]. Typical comp range is $X-$Y.
>
> If that sounds interesting, happy to set up a call. If not, no worries—appreciate you taking the time to respond.

**Why this works:**

- Gives them more information upfront (reduces friction)
- Lets them self-select out if it's not a fit (saves everyone time)
- Still low-pressure

[Providing role details in the first response increases call conversion by 50%](https://www.lever.co/blog/passive-candidate-response-handling/).

## What NOT To Say In LinkedIn Outreach

### ❌ "I have an exciting opportunity"

Every recruiter says this. It means nothing.

**Better:** Describe the actual role specifically.

### ❌ "You'd be a great fit"

You don't know that. You haven't talked to them yet.

**Better:** "I thought this might be relevant given your [specific experience]."

### ❌ "Quick 15-minute call"

Passive candidates don't want to give you 15 minutes without knowing what it's about.

**Better:** Provide details first, then offer a call.

### ❌ "I'd love to pick your brain"

This sounds like you want free consulting, not to recruit them.

**Better:** Be honest: "I'm recruiting for [role]. Thought it might be relevant."

### ❌ Copy-paste their entire work history back to them

"I saw you worked at X from 2018-2020, then moved to Y where you were a Senior Engineer working on Z..."

**They know their own work history.** This is filler that wastes their time.

**Better:** Reference ONE specific thing that's relevant to the role.

## The Subject Line Matters (For InMail)

If you're using LinkedIn InMail (paid messages), the subject line determines whether they open it.

**Bad subject lines:**

- "Exciting opportunity"
- "Great fit for your background"
- "Quick question"

**Good subject lines:**

- "Senior PM role - payment systems"
- "Question about your [Project] work"
- "[Shared connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Distributed systems problem at [Company]"

[Specific subject lines get 2-3x higher open rates than generic ones](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/recruiting-strategy/inmail-subject-line-performance-2025).

## The Bottom Line

**LinkedIn outreach to passive candidates works when it's:**

1. **Personalized** (reference something specific from their profile)
2. **Specific** (say what the role actually is)
3. **Problem-focused** (describe interesting work, not perks)
4. **Low-pressure** (don't demand a call immediately)

**Template you can adapt:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> [One sentence of genuine personalization—reference their work, post, or background.]
>
> I'm recruiting for a [Specific Role Title] at [Company], focused on [Specific Problem/Project]. [One sentence about why this might be interesting given their background.]
>
> Not sure if you're open to exploring new opportunities, but I thought the [problem/project/team] might be relevant. Happy to share more if you're curious.
>
> [Your Name]

[Personalized, low-pressure messages get 20-40% response rates](https://www.lever.co/blog/linkedin-outreach-response-rates-data/). Generic templates get 2-5%.

Stop copy-pasting. Start personalizing. You'll get more responses—and better candidates.
