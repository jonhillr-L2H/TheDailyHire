[AI now handles 95% of initial candidate screening](https://recruiterflow.com/blog/recruitment-trends/), and that number keeps climbing. Resume screening, interview scheduling, initial assessments—automation is everywhere.

[The risk? Your entire recruiting process becomes sterile, robotic, and impersonal](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Candidates feel like they're interacting with machines instead of humans, and that kills your ability to close top talent.

Here's how to use AI tools without destroying candidate experience.

## Be Transparent About When AI Is Being Used

[Candidates appreciate knowing when they're interacting with AI versus humans](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Surprises create distrust.

**In application confirmations:**

"Your application has been received and will be reviewed by our team. [We use AI-assisted screening to identify qualified candidates](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025), and all promising candidates are reviewed by a human recruiter."

**For AI video interviews:**

"You'll complete an initial video screening with our AI interview platform. [This allows us to evaluate candidates consistently and gives you flexibility to complete the interview on your schedule](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Qualified candidates will advance to a conversation with our recruiting team."

[Don't hide AI use—own it and explain why it benefits candidates](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Personalize AI-Generated Messages Before Sending

[AI can draft emails, but you should customize them before hitting send](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**AI-generated template:**

"Thank you for your interest in our organization. We have reviewed your application and would like to proceed to the next stage."

**Personalized version (takes 20 seconds):**

"Hi Sarah—I reviewed your background in product marketing and was impressed by your campaign work at TechCorp. [Your experience with demand gen aligns well with what we're looking for](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Want to chat this week?"

[The second one feels human because it is](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Add one personal detail and adjust the tone. That's it.

## Use Automation for Updates, Humans for Important Conversations

[Automated status updates are fine](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025): "Your application is under review." "We're scheduling second-round interviews this week."

**But certain messages require human touch:**

- Extending offers
- Delivering final-round rejections
- Addressing candidate concerns or questions
- Re-engaging candidates who went silent
- Negotiating compensation

[If the message has emotional weight or strategic importance, a human should send it](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Pro tip:** [Use phone calls for high-stakes messages](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Extending an offer via email (even a personalized one) is less impactful than a 5-minute call.

## Set Realistic Response Time Expectations

[AI can respond instantly, but that creates unrealistic expectations for human interactions](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**In your automated confirmation email:**

"Thank you for applying. [Our team reviews applications within 3-5 business days](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). If your qualifications match our needs, you'll hear from us by [date]."

[Then actually respond within that timeframe](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Nothing destroys trust faster than promising 5 days and ghosting for 3 weeks.

## Don't Over-Automate Senior or Executive Hiring

[AI screening works fine for high-volume mid-level roles](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). It's terrible for senior leadership and executive positions.

**Senior candidates expect:**
- Personalized outreach (not templated InMails)
- Direct communication with hiring managers or executives
- Human interaction from the first touchpoint

[Making a VP candidate complete an AI video interview signals they're not important enough for your time](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). That's how you lose them to competitors.

**Rule:** [The more senior the role, the less automation you should use](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Review AI Screening Decisions Before Auto-Rejecting

[Don't give AI full authority to auto-reject candidates](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Set your tools to recommend, not decide:**

- AI flags candidates as "Strong match," "Possible match," or "Weak match"
- Humans review borderline candidates before rejecting
- [AI misses context—career changers, non-traditional backgrounds, resume gaps with good explanations](https://juicebox.ai/blog/ai-recruitment-mistakes)

[Human review catches those cases and prevents you from auto-rejecting great candidates who don't fit the algorithm's pattern](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Provide Feedback When Candidates Request It

[Most companies send generic rejections with no explanation](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Stand out by offering feedback.

**When someone completes a skills assessment and asks for feedback:**

"You scored well on [X and Y] but struggled with [Z]. [We're looking for candidates with stronger proficiency in Z for this role](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). We'll keep your profile on file for future opportunities that may be a better match."

[Takes 2 minutes to write, massively improves candidate experience, and strengthens your employer brand](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Pick Up the Phone for Re-Engagement

[When you need to re-engage a candidate who went cold, don't rely on automated email sequences](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Call them.**

"Hey Sarah, we connected a few months ago about the product marketing role. That position filled, but we have a new opportunity that I think could be an even better fit. [Do you have 5 minutes to chat?](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)"

[A 5-minute phone call shows you care more than a perfectly worded AI-generated email](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). For competitive candidates, that human touch is the differentiator.

## Customize AI for Your Company's Voice

[Most AI tools use generic corporate templates](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Customize them to match your culture.

**If your company is casual and fun:**

"Hey [Name]! We loved your application for [role]. Your experience at [Company] is exactly what we're looking for. Want to chat this week?"

**If your company is formal and professional:**

"Dear [Name], Thank you for your interest in the [role] position. [After reviewing your qualifications, we'd like to schedule an interview to discuss this opportunity further](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025)."

[Generic messages that could come from any company feel impersonal and hurt employer brand](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Monitor Candidate Feedback on Your AI Tools

[Ask candidates for feedback on their experience](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025):

"How was the AI screening interview?"
"Was the scheduling process easy?"
"Did you feel like you had enough human interaction during the process?"

[If candidates consistently report feeling like they're interacting with robots, dial back the automation](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Track metrics:**
- Application completion rates
- Interview acceptance rates
- Offer acceptance rates
- Glassdoor reviews mentioning candidate experience

[If your metrics decline after implementing AI tools, something's wrong](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Use AI Insights to Have Better Human Conversations

[AI tools generate data about candidates—use that to inform human interactions](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

**Example:**

AI screening flags that a candidate has strong technical skills but weaker communication skills.

[In your interview, focus on assessing communication more deeply](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025): "Tell me about a time you had to explain a complex technical concept to non-technical stakeholders."

[AI should make you smarter and more prepared for conversations, not replace them](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

## Know When to Skip AI Entirely

[Some situations require full human touch from start to finish](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025):

- Executive and C-suite hiring
- Passive candidate outreach (cold sourcing)
- Sensitive situations (returning candidates, internal transfers, boomerang employees)
- Roles requiring exceptional interpersonal skills (sales leadership, customer success executives)

[Don't force AI into every process just because you can](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Sometimes the human approach is the right approach.

## The Bottom Line

[AI tools save time and create efficiency](https://recruiterflow.com/blog/recruitment-trends/). But [recruiting is fundamentally a human activity—building relationships, assessing fit, persuading people to make career decisions](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025).

[Use AI to handle logistics and repetitive tasks so you have more time for human interaction](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Automate scheduling, screening, and status updates. Personalize outreach, provide feedback, and pick up the phone for important conversations.

[Get the balance right, and you'll have efficient processes with strong candidate experience](https://www.applicantpro.com/articles/top-tips-for-talent-acquisition-in-2025). Get it wrong, and you'll have fast recruiting that nobody wants to participate in.

Your call.
