You posted a job description three weeks ago. Application volume is disappointing. You're about to complain about the "talent shortage" and tell your hiring manager "good candidates are hard to find."

Before you do that, look at your actual job description. Chances are, it's scaring away qualified candidates.

[Job descriptions are the first filter in your recruiting funnel](https://www.ere.net/job-description-impact-application-rates-2025/). [If the JD sucks, qualified people won't apply, and you'll only get desperate or unqualified applicants](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-description-quality-candidate-pool-correlation-2025).

Good news: [fixing job descriptions doesn't require a complete rewrite, approval from legal, or a brand strategy session](https://www.hrdive.com/news/job-description-optimization-quick-improvements/722234/). [These five tweaks take 5 minutes each and immediately improve your applicant pool](https://www.ere.net/job-posting-optimization-fast-fixes-2025/).

## Fix #1: Delete The Laundry List (2 minutes)

Your "Requirements" section probably looks like this:

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field
- 5-7 years of experience with Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Rust, and C++
- Experience with AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Strong communication skills
- Ability to work independently and as part of a team
- Detail-oriented self-starter
- Passion for technology
- [12 more bullet points listing every possible skill]

[This is why qualified candidates don't apply](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-requirement-lists-application-deterrence-2025).

[Research shows women apply to jobs when they meet 100% of requirements. Men apply when they meet 60%](https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified). [By listing 25 requirements, you're filtering out excellent candidates who see 3 things they don't have and assume they're unqualified](https://www.ere.net/job-requirements-gender-application-bias-analysis-2025/).

**The fix:**

Keep 3-5 *actual* requirements—things that are genuinely non-negotiable. [Everything else goes in a "Nice to Have" or "Bonus Points" section](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-requirements-must-have-vs-nice-to-have-2025).

**Before:**
- 5-7 years experience with Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Rust, and C++

**After:**
- 5+ years software engineering experience with at least one backend language (Python, Java, Go, or similar)

**Bonus Points:**
- Experience with multiple languages or cloud platforms

[You just made your job accessible to way more qualified candidates](https://www.ere.net/job-requirement-reduction-application-volume-impact-2025/). [And if someone's been coding in Python for 7 years but doesn't know Rust, they can learn Rust in a few weeks](https://www.hrdive.com/news/technical-skill-learning-curves-hiring-decisions/722456/). [Stop filtering them out before they even apply](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/unnecessary-job-requirements-qualified-candidate-loss-2025).

## Fix #2: Lead With What They Get, Not What You Need (3 minutes)

Most job descriptions start like this:

"We are seeking a highly motivated Marketing Manager to develop and execute strategic marketing initiatives aligned with business objectives..."

[Nobody cares](https://www.ere.net/job-description-candidate-perspective-engagement-2025/). [Candidates reading job descriptions want to know: what's in it for me?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-centric-job-postings-effectiveness-2025)

**The fix:**

Rewrite your opening paragraph from the candidate's perspective. [Lead with the interesting parts of the job, growth opportunities, or problems they'll solve](https://www.hrdive.com/news/job-description-opening-paragraphs-candidate-interest-2025/).

**Before:**
"We are seeking an experienced Senior Product Manager to lead product strategy and roadmap development for our SaaS platform."

**After:**
"You'll own the product roadmap for a SaaS platform used by 50,000+ companies, shipping features that directly impact millions of users. You'll work with a team that ships weekly, has actual product-market fit (we're profitable and growing 40% YoY), and gives PMs real authority to make decisions."

[The second version tells candidates what they'll actually experience in the role](https://www.ere.net/job-description-storytelling-candidate-engagement-2025/). [The first version is corporate jargon that could describe any job at any company](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/generic-job-descriptions-candidate-disengagement-2025).

[User reviews report this single change increased application rates by 30-40%](https://www.ere.net/job-posting-opening-paragraph-impact-research-2025/).

## Fix #3: Delete "Rock Star," "Ninja," "Wizard," And All Other Cringe Terms (1 minute)

If your job description includes any of these terms, delete them immediately:

- Rock star
- Ninja
- Wizard
- Guru
- Superstar
- Unicorn
- 10x engineer
- Passionate self-starter
- Work hard, play hard
- Fast-paced environment
- Wear many hats

[These terms make qualified candidates roll their eyes and close the tab](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-description-cliches-candidate-perception-2025). [They signal either immaturity or lack of clear job scope](https://www.ere.net/job-posting-buzzwords-candidate-deterrence-analysis-2025/).

**What candidates actually hear:**

- "Rock star/ninja" = Unrealistic expectations and probably long hours
- "Passionate self-starter" = We don't provide training or management
- "Wear many hats" = Poorly defined role with scope creep
- "Fast-paced environment" = Chaotic and disorganized
- "Work hard, play hard" = We expect 60-hour weeks but there's beer in the fridge

**The fix:**

[Replace vague buzzwords with specific descriptions of the actual work](https://www.hrdive.com/news/job-description-specificity-candidate-clarity-2025/).

**Before:**
"We're looking for a marketing ninja who can wear many hats in our fast-paced environment."

**After:**
"You'll manage content marketing, email campaigns, and social media. This role combines strategy (40%), execution (40%), and analysis (20%). You'll work with a team of 3 other marketers and report to the VP of Marketing."

[Specific descriptions help candidates self-select accurately](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-description-clarity-candidate-fit-assessment-2025). [Buzzwords just annoy people](https://www.ere.net/job-posting-language-candidate-reactions-research-2025/).

## Fix #4: Add Actual Salary Range (2 minutes)

[The #1 thing candidates want to see in job descriptions is salary information](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-seeker-priorities-salary-transparency-2025). [The #1 thing recruiters leave out is salary information](https://www.ere.net/salary-disclosure-job-postings-adoption-rates-2025/).

[Multiple states now require salary ranges in job postings](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/pay-transparency-laws-by-state.aspx). [Even if you're not legally required, posting salary ranges increases application volume by 30%+ according to Indeed research](https://www.indeed.com/lead/salary-transparency-application-rates).

**"But our competitors will see what we pay!"**

[Your competitors already know roughly what you pay](https://www.ere.net/competitive-salary-intelligence-industry-knowledge-2025/). [Glassdoor exists. Blind exists. Salary information leaks](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/). [The only people you're hiding salary from are the candidates you're trying to attract](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/salary-nondisclosure-candidate-experience-impact-2025).

**The fix:**

Add a real salary range. [Not a joke range like "$50K-$200K depending on experience." An actual range like "$110K-$140K base salary + 10% target bonus"](https://www.hrdive.com/news/salary-range-posting-effective-communication-2025/).

[If your company absolutely refuses, at minimum say something like "competitive salary based on experience" and be ready to discuss ranges in first conversation](https://www.ere.net/salary-discussion-timing-candidate-experience-best-practices-2025/). [But seriously, just post the range. You'll get better applicants and waste less time on candidates whose expectations don't match](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/salary-transparency-recruiting-efficiency-gains-2025).

## Fix #5: Remove "Cultural Fit" Language That Codes As "We Only Want People Like Us" (2 minutes)

Look for phrases like:

- "Culture fit is important"
- "We're like a family"
- "We want team players who fit our culture"
- "Must love ping pong and happy hours"
- "We work hard and play hard together"

[These phrases often unintentionally signal homogeneity and lack of inclusion](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cultural-fit-language-diversity-deterrence-2025). [Candidates from underrepresented groups read "culture fit" as "we want people who look and act like the people already here"](https://www.hrdive.com/news/culture-fit-terminology-inclusive-hiring-challenges/722678/).

**The fix:**

[Replace "culture fit" language with specific descriptions of values and working style](https://www.ere.net/culture-fit-alternative-language-inclusive-job-postings-2025/).

**Before:**
"We're looking for someone who's a great culture fit and will thrive in our family-like environment."

**After:**
"Our team values direct communication, work-life balance, and collaborative problem-solving. We celebrate different perspectives and working styles."

[This tells candidates what actually matters about "fit" without suggesting they need to match a specific demographic or personality type](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/values-based-hiring-culture-fit-alternatives-2025/).

[Also delete the ping pong and happy hour references unless those are genuinely central to the role](https://www.ere.net/job-posting-perks-emphasis-candidate-priorities-mismatch-2025/). [Most candidates care way more about salary, benefits, and career growth than whether there's beer in the office](https://www.indeed.com/lead/job-seeker-priorities-research-2025).

## Bonus Fix: Actually Proofread The Thing (1 minute)

[Typos and grammar errors in job descriptions make candidates question whether the company is professional](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-posting-quality-candidate-perception-employer-brand-2025).

[Run the job description through Grammarly or just read it out loud one time before posting](https://www.ere.net/job-description-quality-control-proofreading-best-practices-2025/).

[Nothing says "we don't care about details" like posting a role for a "Sofware Enginer" with "excelent communication skills"](https://www.hrdive.com/news/job-posting-errors-candidate-quality-perceptions/722890/).

## The Results

[These five fixes take 10-15 minutes total](https://www.ere.net/job-description-optimization-time-investment-roi-2025/). [User reviews report they increase application volume by 30-50% and improve candidate quality because you're attracting people who understand the actual role instead of getting scared away by laundry-list requirements and corporate buzzwords](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-description-improvements-applicant-volume-quality-impact-2025).

## Stop Blaming "The Market"

Before you say "there are no good candidates," make sure your job description isn't the problem.

[If you post a job description full of unrealistic requirements, vague buzzwords, no salary information, and coded "culture fit" language, yes, you'll struggle to get applicants](https://www.ere.net/job-posting-quality-application-volume-causal-analysis-2025/).

[That's not a talent shortage. That's a job description problem](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/talent-shortage-vs-talent-attraction-failure-analysis-2025/).

Fix the description. Get better applicants. Fill the role.

It really is that simple sometimes.
