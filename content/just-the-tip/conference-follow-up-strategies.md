You just attended ERE, HR Tech Week, or another recruiting conference. You went to sessions, networked during breaks, exchanged business cards with 30 people, and sent LinkedIn connection requests on the flight home.

Now what?

Most people send a generic "great meeting you!" message, get a polite response, and never speak again. The connection goes into the LinkedIn graveyard of people you met once and will never talk to.

Here's how to actually follow up after conferences in a way that builds real, valuable relationships—not just another dead-end LinkedIn connection.

## The Problem with "Great Meeting You!" Messages

The default conference follow-up message looks like this:

> "Hi [Name], it was great meeting you at ERE! Let's stay in touch."

This message is:
- **Vague** (what did we even talk about?)
- **Generic** (they got 20 identical messages from other conference attendees)
- **Low-commitment** ("let's stay in touch" = "I'll never contact you again")

The person responds politely ("yes, let's!"), and then nothing happens.

## The Follow-Up Framework That Works

Here's a better approach:

### 1. Reference a Specific Conversation

Don't just say "it was great meeting you." Reference something specific you discussed.

❌ **Generic:**
> "Hi Maria, it was great meeting you at ERE. Let's stay in touch!"

✅ **Specific:**
> "Hi Maria, really enjoyed our conversation about AI bias in resume screening—your point about the 'garbage in, garbage out' problem with training data was spot-on. We're running into the exact same issue at my company."

The specific reference proves you actually remember the conversation and aren't just mass-messaging everyone you met.

### 2. Offer Value First

Don't lead with an ask. Lead with giving.

Send something useful related to your conversation:
- An article related to what you discussed
- An introduction to someone who could help them
- A tool or resource they mentioned wanting to find
- A follow-up answer to a question they asked

**Example:**
> "You mentioned you were looking for a better candidate assessment tool that doesn't break the bank. I've been using TestGorilla for the past 6 months—not perfect, but way better than our old solution. Happy to chat about our experience if that's helpful."

Leading with value makes the follow-up feel like the continuation of a conversation, not a transactional networking move.

### 3. Make a Specific Ask (If You Have One)

If you want something from the connection, be direct about it. But make the ask specific and reasonable.

❌ **Vague ask:**
> "Would love to pick your brain sometime!"

✅ **Specific ask:**
> "You mentioned your team successfully implemented skills-based hiring last year. We're planning to roll it out in Q1 2026. Would you be open to a 20-minute call where I ask you 5-10 specific questions about what worked and what didn't?"

The specific ask:
- Shows you value their time (20 minutes, not "sometime")
- Explains why you're asking (we're implementing the same thing)
- Makes it clear what you need (5-10 questions about their experience)

This is easy to say yes to.

### 4. Follow Up Within 48 Hours (Not 2 Weeks)

The best time to follow up: within 48 hours of the conference.

Why:
- They still remember you
- The conference is still fresh in their mind
- They're probably doing their own follow-ups, so they're in "networking mode"

If you wait 2 weeks, you're just another random LinkedIn connection from that conference they vaguely remember attending.

## Scripts for Different Follow-Up Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You Want to Build a Long-Term Relationship (No Immediate Ask)

> "Hi [Name], really enjoyed our conversation at ERE about [specific topic]. Your perspective on [specific insight] made me rethink how we're approaching [relevant challenge].
>
> I'm sending you an article I just read about [related topic]—thought you might find it interesting given our discussion. No need to respond, just wanted to share.
>
> Looking forward to staying connected."

This positions you as someone who gives value, not just someone who collects contacts.

### Scenario 2: You Want Their Advice on Something

> "Hi [Name], I've been thinking about your experience with [topic we discussed]. We're facing a similar challenge at my company, and I'd love your input.
>
> Would you be open to a 15-20 minute call where I walk you through what we're doing and get your thoughts on [specific question]?
>
> I know you're busy, so no pressure—but if you have time in the next couple weeks, I'd really value your perspective."

This is direct but respectful of their time.

### Scenario 3: You Can Help Them with Something

> "Hi [Name], you mentioned at ERE that you were looking for [specific thing]. I might be able to help—[explain how].
>
> Want to jump on a quick call this week to discuss? Happy to share what's worked for us."

Leading with how you can help them builds goodwill and starts the relationship on a positive note.

### Scenario 4: You Want to Introduce Them to Someone

> "Hi [Name], after our conversation at ERE about [topic], I immediately thought of my colleague [Person] who's working on [related project]. I think you two should connect—[explain why].
>
> Want me to make an intro?"

Facilitating valuable introductions is one of the best ways to build professional relationships.

## How to Keep the Relationship Going After the Initial Follow-Up

The initial follow-up is easy. The hard part: keeping the relationship alive over time.

### Monthly Touchpoints (Pick One)

**Share relevant content**
When you see an article, tool, or resource related to something they care about, send it with a note: "Thought of you when I saw this."

**Make introductions**
When you meet someone who shares their interests or challenges, facilitate an introduction.

**Ask for their input**
When you're facing a challenge they have expertise in, ask for their perspective (but don't abuse this—don't become the person who only reaches out when you need something).

**Celebrate their wins**
If they get promoted, their company announces funding, or they publish something, send a quick congratulations message.

The goal: stay on their radar without being annoying.

## The Conferences Worth Following Up On

Not every conference is worth intensive follow-up. Prioritize based on:

**Quality of conversations**
Did you have substantive conversations, or just small talk? Deep conversations are worth following up on; surface-level chit-chat isn't.

**Relevance to your goals**
Are these people working on challenges you care about? In roles you aspire to? At companies you're curious about? Prioritize accordingly.

**Mutual value potential**
Can you help them? Can they help you? The best relationships are mutually beneficial, not one-sided.

## The Bottom Line

Most people treat conference networking as a transaction: collect cards, connect on LinkedIn, never speak again.

The people who build real relationships from conferences do these things:
1. **Follow up within 48 hours** with a specific reference to your conversation
2. **Offer value first** (article, introduction, resource, etc.) before making asks
3. **Make specific, reasonable asks** when you need something
4. **Stay in touch over time** with monthly touchpoints (share content, make intros, celebrate wins)

Conferences like ERE and HR Tech Week are expensive (registration, travel, time away from work). The ROI comes from the relationships you build, not from the sessions you attend.

Most attendees waste that ROI by failing to follow up effectively. Don't be most attendees.

Send thoughtful, specific follow-ups within 48 hours. Offer value. Make reasonable asks. Stay in touch.

That's how you turn a stack of business cards into a network that actually helps your career.
