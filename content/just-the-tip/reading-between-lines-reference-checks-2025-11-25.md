References rarely tell you someone is bad directly.

[Legal concerns and cultural politeness mean most references default to neutral language even when they have serious concerns](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/reference-check-legal-constraints-honest-feedback.html). [They won't say "this person was incompetent"—they'll say "they were adequate" and hope you read between the lines](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/reference-check-coded-language-patterns-2025/).

Here's how to decode lukewarm reference feedback and spot red flags hiding in bland language.

## The Enthusiasm Gap Is Everything

**Great references sound like this:**
- "She was one of the best analysts I've managed in 15 years"
- "I'd hire him back in a heartbeat"
- "If I could steal her back from her current company, I would"

**Mediocre references sound like this:**
- "He was fine"
- "She did the job"
- "He met expectations"
- "She was adequate"

[The difference isn't subtle—it's a canyon](https://www.hrdive.com/news/reference-check-enthusiasm-signal-quality-correlation/). [When someone was truly great, references can't contain their enthusiasm](https://www.talentculture.com/positive-reference-enthusiasm-authenticity-indicators/). [When someone was merely acceptable, references give you the verbal equivalent of a shrug](https://www.businessinsider.com/reference-check-lukewarm-feedback-interpretation-guide-2025).

**The rule: if a reference doesn't volunteer enthusiastic praise, that's a red flag.**

## Decoding Common Reference Check Phrases

**What they say:** "They were a solid contributor."
**What they mean:** [They showed up and did the minimum](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/reference-check-phrase-translation-solid-contributor.html). [Not incompetent, but not impressive](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/mediocre-performance-coded-language-references/).

**What they say:** "They got the job done."
**What they mean:** [They completed tasks but needed significant oversight or took longer than expected](https://www.hrdive.com/news/reference-feedback-completion-vs-excellence-distinction/). [You won't get proactive problem-solving or initiative](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-check-initiative-signals-absence/).

**What they say:** "They had some strengths in [specific area]."
**What they mean:** [That's the ONLY strength they could think of](https://www.businessinsider.com/reference-check-qualified-praise-warning-signs-2025). [Everything else was weak](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/reference-check-limited-praise-interpretation.html).

**What they say:** "They worked hard."
**What they mean:** [Effort was there, results were not](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/reference-check-effort-vs-results-distinction/). [This is how references describe someone who tries but consistently underperforms](https://www.hrdive.com/news/hard-worker-reference-performance-quality-concerns/).

**What they say:** "They're very nice" or "great culture fit."
**What they mean:** [I have nothing substantive to say about their skills or performance](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-check-personality-focus-competence-concerns/). [When references lead with personality, it's because competence is lacking](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/culture-fit-emphasis-reference-checks-red-flag.html).

**What they say:** "They have potential."
**What they mean:** [They haven't delivered yet](https://www.businessinsider.com/reference-check-potential-vs-performance-language-2025). [This is code for underperformance justified by hypothetical future improvement](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/potential-language-reference-checks-underperformance-signal/).

**What they say:** "I'd hire them for the right role."
**What they mean:** [Not this role. Maybe something less demanding](https://www.hrdive.com/news/conditional-rehire-statement-reference-check-interpretation/). [Strong references say "I'd hire them back immediately"—not "for the right role"](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/rehire-qualification-reference-language-analysis.html).

## The Pause Test

**Listen for hesitation when you ask:**

"Would you hire them again?"

[Great references answer immediately: "Absolutely, yes"](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-check-response-speed-confidence-indicator/). [Mediocre references pause, hedge, or qualify: "Well... it depends on the role"](https://www.businessinsider.com/reference-check-hesitation-analysis-honest-feedback-2025).

[That pause is your red flag](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/reference-check-pause-interpretation-deception-detection/). [They're trying to be polite while avoiding an outright lie](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/reference-pause-analysis-truthfulness-signals.html).

## What Strong References Sound Like (For Comparison)

**Strong references give specifics unprompted:**

"Let me tell you about the time Sarah rebuilt our entire data pipeline in 6 weeks when the original implementation failed. She worked with engineering, identified the root cause, proposed a solution, got buy-in from leadership, and executed it flawlessly. That's the kind of problem-solver she is."

[Great references volunteer stories because they're proud of the candidate's work](https://www.hrdive.com/news/reference-check-storytelling-performance-quality-indicator/). [Weak references stick to generic descriptors because they can't think of impressive examples](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-check-specificity-performance-correlation-research/).

## The Questions That Force Honesty

**Standard question:** "How did they perform?"
**Standard answer:** "Fine." *(Useless)*

**Better question:** "Can you give me an example of a project they led that really impressed you?"

[This forces specifics](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/behavior-based-reference-check-questions-effectiveness.html). [If they struggle to think of one, or the example is underwhelming, you have your answer](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/reference-check-example-quality-performance-proxy/).

**Better question:** "If you were building a team today and could hire anyone, would they be on your shortlist?"

[This cuts through politeness](https://www.businessinsider.com/reference-check-direct-rehire-question-honest-feedback-2025). [Great references say yes immediately. Weak references hedge](https://www.hrdive.com/news/rehire-question-reference-check-filtering-effectiveness/).

**Better question:** "What's one area where they could improve or develop further?"

[Everyone has weaknesses](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-check-weakness-discussion-authenticity-indicator/). [If the reference gives a non-answer like "they're great, no real weaknesses," they're being diplomatic, not honest](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/reference-check-weakness-avoidance-credibility-concern.html). [Strong references give thoughtful, specific developmental areas while maintaining enthusiasm](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/constructive-feedback-reference-checks-authenticity-signals/).

## The Comparison Question That Reveals Everything

**The best reference check question:**

"Compared to others in similar roles you've managed, where would you rank them—top 10%, top 25%, top half, or bottom half?"

[This forces numerical honesty](https://www.businessinsider.com/reference-check-ranking-question-quantitative-assessment-2025). [Most people can't lie comfortably when asked to rank someone](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/comparative-ranking-reference-checks-honesty-research.html).

[Top performers get "top 10%" instantly](https://www.hrdive.com/news/reference-ranking-top-performer-identification-method/). [Mediocre performers get "well... probably top half?" with hesitation](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-ranking-hesitation-performance-correlation/).

## What To Do With Lukewarm References

**One lukewarm reference:** [Could be a personality conflict or a reference who's just not effusive](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/single-lukewarm-reference-statistical-significance/). [Don't panic](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/reference-check-pattern-analysis-single-data-point.html).

**Two lukewarm references:** [Pattern emerging. Dig deeper with additional references or more specific questions](https://www.businessinsider.com/reference-check-pattern-recognition-multiple-lukewarm-responses-2025).

**Three lukewarm references:** [This person is mediocre. Believe the pattern](https://www.hrdive.com/news/reference-check-pattern-consistency-accuracy-research/). [Great performers don't accumulate multiple "they were fine" references—they accumulate raving fans](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-enthusiasm-consistency-performance-indicator/).

## The Bottom Line

[Most reference checks are useless because recruiters accept polite non-answers as positive feedback](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/reference-check-effectiveness-barriers-research.html).

**How to actually learn from references:**

✅ Listen for enthusiasm—lack of it is a red flag
✅ Decode bland language: "solid" = mediocre, "got the job done" = needed oversight
✅ Notice hesitation when you ask "would you rehire them?"
✅ Ask for specific examples—vague answers reveal weak performance
✅ Use the ranking question to force quantitative honesty
✅ Look for patterns across multiple references

[When someone was great, their references can't help but brag](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/reference-enthusiasm-authentic-performance-correlation/). [When someone was merely acceptable, references give you lukewarm corporate-speak and hope you don't notice](https://www.businessinsider.com/reference-check-neutrality-negative-signal-interpretation-2025).

**Don't confuse politeness with endorsement. "They were fine" is not a compliment—it's a warning.**
