[The best candidates aren't actively job searching—they're happily employed and not checking job boards](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruiting-tips/recruiting-passive-candidates). This is both a challenge and an opportunity. Challenge because you can't just post a job and wait. Opportunity because if you can actually engage passive candidates effectively, you're accessing talent your competitors are missing.

Here's how to source passive candidates without being that annoying recruiter everyone ignores.

## Step 1: Find Them (The Right Way)

**Boolean search is your friend.** [Use LinkedIn Recruiter or free LinkedIn + Boolean operators to find people with the exact experience you need](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/boolean-search-techniques-recruiters).

Example for finding senior product managers:
```
(Senior OR Lead OR Principal) AND ("Product Manager" OR "Product Lead") AND (SaaS OR B2B) AND (San Francisco OR "Bay Area" OR Remote)
```

[Add exclusions to filter out people who are clearly job hunting](https://www.ere.net/boolean-search-passive-candidates/):
```
NOT ("Open to opportunities" OR "Actively looking" OR "Available immediately")
```

**Check GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Behance.** [For technical and creative roles, these platforms show you actual work quality, not just resume claims](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-overflow-98-developers-vs-job-interviews/). Someone with high-reputation Stack Overflow answers or popular GitHub repos is worth reaching out to even if their LinkedIn is sparse.

**Look at company alumni networks.** [People who worked at companies similar to yours or at companies you admire are often good targets](https://recruitingdaily.com/sourcing-from-competitor-companies/). They understand the space and might be ready for a new challenge.

## Step 2: Research Before You Reach Out

[This is where 90% of recruiters fail](https://www.ere.net/personalized-recruiter-outreach-2025/). They send generic template messages to hundreds of people and wonder why response rates are 2%.

**Before sending a message, spend 2 minutes reviewing:**
- Their recent work/projects (LinkedIn posts, GitHub commits, articles they've written)
- How long they've been at current company (0-6 months = don't bother; 2-4 years = prime time)
- What they care about professionally (what do they post/share about?)
- Mutual connections (any shared contacts you can reference?)

[This research lets you personalize your outreach in a way that shows you're not mass-spamming](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/personalized-inmails-response-rates).

## Step 3: Craft a Message That Doesn't Suck

[The average recruiter InMail gets a 10-15% response rate](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/linkedin-inmails/2023/how-to-improve-inmail-response-rates). [Personalized messages from recruiters who did their homework get 40-50%](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/inmail-personalization-impact).

**Bad InMail (what everyone sends):**
```
Hi [Name],

I came across your profile and was impressed by your background. I'm working with a great company that's looking for someone with your skills. Would you be open to a quick chat to learn more?

Best,
[Recruiter]
```

[This is generic garbage that gets ignored](https://www.askamanager.org/2023/11/recruiter-messages-that-dont-work.html).

**Good InMail (what actually works):**
```
Hi [Name],

I saw your recent post about [specific thing they posted/wrote about]. Your perspective on [topic] really resonated—especially the point about [specific detail].

I'm recruiting for a [role] at [company], and given your experience leading [specific project they worked on], I thought it might be worth a conversation. We're tackling [specific problem that aligns with their interests], and I think you'd find the challenge interesting.

Not sure if you're open to exploring opportunities right now, but would love to chat briefly either way. Even if the timing isn't right, happy to stay connected.

Let me know if you're up for a 15-minute call this week.

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- [Shows you actually looked at their profile](https://recruitingdaily.com/personalized-recruiting-messages/)
- References something specific to build credibility
- [Clearly states what the opportunity is](https://www.ere.net/recruiter-inmail-clarity/)
- Acknowledges they might not be interested (lowers pressure)
- [Specific ask (15-minute call this week) is easier to say yes to than vague "chat sometime"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/effective-call-to-action-recruiter-messages)

## Step 4: Timing and Follow-Up

**When to reach out:** [Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM or 2-4 PM in the candidate's time zone get best response rates](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/best-time-to-send-inmails). Avoid Mondays (inbox chaos) and Fridays (checked out for the weekend).

**Follow-up strategy:**
- **Day 0:** Send initial message
- **Day 3:** If no response, send a short follow-up: "Hey [Name], following up on my message from Tuesday. Would love to connect briefly about the [Role] opportunity. Let me know if you have 15 minutes this week."
- **Day 7:** If still no response, send final message: "Last message, promise! If the timing isn't right or you're not interested, totally understand. If you are interested, I'd love to chat. Either way, happy to stay connected for the future."
- **After that:** [Move on. Passive candidates who ignore 3 personalized messages aren't interested. Continuing to message them is harassment, not persistence](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/09/recruiter-follow-up-how-many-is-too-many.html).

## Step 5: The Conversation (Don't Screw This Up)

[If they respond and agree to talk, your goal is to gauge interest without pressuring them](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruiting-tips/recruiting-passive-candidates).

**Open with curiosity, not a pitch:**
"Thanks for taking the time. I'm curious—how are things going at [Current Company]? Are you pretty happy there, or would you be open to hearing about other opportunities?"

[This gives them an easy out ("I'm happy where I am") or an opening to express interest](https://www.ere.net/passive-candidate-phone-screen-approach/).

**If they're potentially interested, share specifics:**
- What the company does and why it's interesting
- What the role entails and why you thought of them
- Comp range (don't dance around this—[passive candidates won't move without knowing it's worth their time](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/passive-candidate-salary-expectations/))
- Why this would be a career growth opportunity

**If they're not interested right now:**
"Totally understand. Would it be okay if I stay in touch? I work on a lot of [type of roles], and I'd love to reach out if something comes up that might be a fit."

[This keeps the door open for future opportunities](https://recruitingdaily.com/talent-relationship-management-passive-candidates/).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Sending the same template to 500 people.** [Mass outreach = mass ignore](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/inmail-personalization-impact).

❌ **Not mentioning comp range.** [Passive candidates won't waste time on exploratory calls if they don't know if the comp is even in the ballpark](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/passive-candidate-compensation-conversation).

❌ **Being vague about the opportunity.** "Great company, exciting role" tells them nothing. [Be specific about what makes this worth their time](https://www.ere.net/recruiter-outreach-specificity/).

❌ **Pressuring them to decide quickly.** [Passive candidates need time to consider. Pushing too hard makes them disengage](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruiting-tips/recruiting-passive-candidates).

❌ **Only reaching out when you have a role to fill.** [Build relationships before you need them. Passive candidate pipelines pay off long-term](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/talent-pipeline-relationship-building).

## The Bottom Line

[Sourcing passive candidates is about quality over quantity](https://www.ere.net/passive-candidate-recruiting-strategy-2025/). You can send 500 generic InMails and get 20 responses, or you can send 50 highly personalized messages and get 20 responses. One approach wastes your time and annoys candidates. The other builds your reputation as a recruiter who actually knows what they're doing.

[Do your research. Personalize your outreach. Be specific about the opportunity. Respect their time and decision. Build relationships for the long term](https://recruitingdaily.com/passive-candidate-recruiting-best-practices/).

That's the tip. Use it.

**Quick Reference:**

- **Find them:** Boolean search + GitHub/Stack Overflow for technical roles
- **Research first:** 2 minutes per candidate—recent work, tenure, interests, mutual connections
- **Message that works:** Reference something specific + clear opportunity description + low-pressure ask
- **Follow-up:** Day 3 and Day 7, then move on
- **Conversation:** Gauge interest, share specifics (including comp), keep door open if not interested now
- **Build relationships:** Stay in touch even when you don't have an immediate role
