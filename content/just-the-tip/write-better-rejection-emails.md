You're about to send a rejection email to a candidate who went through three rounds of interviews. You copy-paste your standard template, hit send, and move on.

What you don't realize: That candidate just became a permanent "never working there" person. And they're telling their network about the experience.

Here's how to write rejection emails that maintain relationships instead of torching them.

## Why This Matters More Than You Think

That candidate you're rejecting today might be:
- Perfect for a different role in six months
- A referral source for future candidates
- Connected to your next great hire
- A customer, client, or partner
- Someone who posts about their experience on social media

Your rejection email is either building your employer brand or destroying it. Choose wisely.

## The Standard Rejection Email (And Why It's Terrible)

Most rejection emails sound like this:

*"Thank you for your interest in [Company Name]. After careful consideration, we have decided to move forward with other candidates whose qualifications more closely match our needs. We wish you the best in your job search."*

This email tells the candidate:
- You weren't good enough
- We won't tell you why
- This is an automated template
- We don't actually care about your job search

Great way to make someone feel valued! Super effective at maintaining relationships!

## What Makes a Good Rejection Email

A good rejection email does three things:

**1. Acknowledges the candidate's effort**
They spent hours on your interview process. A generic template is insulting.

**2. Provides specific feedback (when possible)**
"Other candidates were a better fit" tells them nothing. Specific feedback helps them improve.

**3. Leaves the door open**
If they were good but not quite right, say that. You might want to hire them later.

## Template for Candidates After Phone Screens

*Subject: Update on [Role Name] Position*

*Hi [Name],*

*Thank you for taking the time to speak with me about the [Role Name] position. I appreciated learning about your background in [specific thing they mentioned].*

*After reviewing all candidates, we've decided to move forward with someone whose experience aligns more closely with our immediate needs, specifically [specific reason if appropriate, e.g., "industry background in healthcare tech" or "hands-on experience with our specific tech stack"].*

*I was impressed by [something specific and genuine], and I'd like to keep your information on file for future opportunities that might be a better match. Would it be alright if I reach out if something relevant opens up?*

*Best of luck with your search, and thank you again for your time.*

*[Your name]*

**Why this works**: It's personal, specific, and honest without being harsh. The candidate knows why they weren't selected and doesn't feel like a number.

## Template for Candidates After Multiple Rounds

*Subject: [Role Name] Position - Final Update*

*Hi [Name],*

*I wanted to reach out personally regarding the [Role Name] position. This was an incredibly difficult decision—you made it to our final round for a reason, and the team was genuinely impressed by [specific thing, e.g., "your approach to the case study" or "your thoughtful questions about our product roadmap"].*

*Ultimately, we decided to move forward with a candidate who had [specific differentiator, e.g., "direct experience in our specific market segment" or "hands-on background with the exact systems we use"]. It came down to a very specific fit for this particular role.*

*I want to be clear: this was about fit for this role, not about your capabilities. [Something encouraging and specific, e.g., "Your experience in X and your approach to Y were standout qualities."].*

*I'd love to stay connected and reach out if a role opens that might be an even better match. Would you be open to me keeping your information and contacting you about future opportunities?*

*Thank you for the time and energy you invested in this process. I know multiple interview rounds are a significant commitment, and I genuinely appreciate it.*

*Best,*
*[Your name]*

**Why this works**: After multiple rounds, candidates deserve more than a template. This acknowledges their effort, provides specific feedback, and maintains the relationship.

## When To Provide Detailed Feedback (And When Not To)

**Provide specific feedback when:**
- The candidate made it past the first round
- You have clear, constructive reasons for the decision
- The feedback could genuinely help them improve
- You'd consider them for future roles

**Don't provide detailed feedback when:**
- They weren't qualified and shouldn't have been interviewed
- The feedback would be subjective or potentially hurtful
- There are legal concerns about what you say
- They were disrespectful or inappropriate in the process

## The Fast Rejection (For Clearly Unqualified Candidates)

For candidates who applied but clearly aren't qualified, a faster, simpler rejection is fine:

*Subject: Update on Your Application*

*Hi [Name],*

*Thank you for applying to [Role Name] at [Company]. After reviewing your application, we've determined that your background doesn't align with what we're looking for in this particular role.*

*I encourage you to check our careers page for other positions that might be a better match for your skills and experience.*

*Best of luck in your search,*
*[Your name]*

**Why this works**: It's fast, honest, and doesn't waste their time. They weren't close, you're not pretending otherwise, everyone can move on.

## Common Rejection Email Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Taking too long**
Don't leave candidates hanging for weeks after a final interview. Three days maximum for final decisions.

**Mistake #2: Being vague to avoid awkwardness**
"We're going in a different direction" tells them nothing and helps no one.

**Mistake #3: Lying about keeping them on file**
Don't say you'll keep their info if you won't. Candidates know it's usually BS.

**Mistake #4: Over-explaining**
You don't need to justify your entire decision-making process. Be concise.

**Mistake #5: Generic templates for everyone**
A candidate who went through four rounds deserves more than someone who applied but wasn't qualified.

## The Magic Phrase That Keeps Doors Open

Include this in rejections for strong candidates:

*"While you weren't the right fit for this specific role, I was impressed by [specific quality]. Would you be open to me reaching out if something that's a better match opens up?"*

Most candidates will say yes. Now you have permission to contact them later. And they feel valued instead of rejected.

## What To Do When They Ask For Feedback

Sometimes candidates reply asking for specific feedback. Have a response ready:

*"Thanks for asking. The team felt [specific, constructive feedback if you can provide it]. For context, the candidate we moved forward with had [differentiating factor]. I'd encourage you to [specific actionable advice if appropriate]. Feel free to apply again if you see other roles that interest you."*

Be helpful if you can. If you can't provide more detail, say so honestly rather than being vague.

## The Bottom Line

Your rejection emails are an extension of your employer brand. Every candidate you reject is either:
- Someone who might be perfect for a future role
- Someone who might refer great candidates to you
- Someone who will tell others about their experience

Spend an extra two minutes writing a thoughtful rejection instead of copy-pasting a generic template. Acknowledge effort. Provide specific feedback when appropriate. Leave the door open for strong candidates.

Your future self—trying to fill a role and wishing you had maintained better candidate relationships—will thank you.

**The Fast Version:**
- Personalize rejection emails (at least a little)
- Acknowledge the candidate's time and effort
- Provide specific feedback when possible
- Be faster with rejections (3 days max after final interviews)
- Keep doors open with strong candidates
- Never send a rejection email that burns a bridge you might want to cross later
