[LinkedIn job scams are exploding in 2025](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2025/01/linkedin-job-scams-rise). Fake companies posting real-looking jobs. Real companies posting ghost jobs they never intend to fill. [Scammers cloning legitimate company pages to extract money or personal information from desperate job seekers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linkedin-verification-exploited-job-scams/).

[The result? Job seekers waste hours applying to positions that don't exist or are outright scams](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams).

Here's your practical checklist to identify fake job postings before you waste time applying.

## Red Flag #1: The Company Page Looks Suspicious

Before applying, click on the company name and examine their LinkedIn page.

**Warning signs:**

**Newly created page (less than 6 months old)** - [Scammers create fresh company pages specifically for fake job postings](https://www.linkedin.com/safety/fake-accounts). Check when the company joined LinkedIn. If it's brand new but claims to be an established company, that's suspicious.

**Very few employees listed** - [Real companies have employees on LinkedIn. If a "500-person company" has 3 employees listed, something's wrong](https://www.bbb.org/article/scams/22128-how-to-spot-a-fake-job-posting).

**No company website or website is brand new** - [Google the company. If there's no website, no reviews, no online presence beyond LinkedIn, it's likely fake](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams). Use tools like [Whois lookup](https://www.whois.com/whois/) to check when the domain was registered. A website created last month for a "10-year-old company"? Red flag.

**Company description is vague or generic** - [Scammers copy-paste generic descriptions like "leading provider of innovative solutions"](https://www.zippia.com/advice/how-to-spot-fake-job-postings/). Real companies describe specific products, services, or industries.

**Mismatched information** - [Company claims to be headquartered in San Francisco but the address is a residential building in Ohio](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/fake-job-posting-warning-signs). Google the address. Scammers use fake addresses or virtual office services.

## Red Flag #2: The Job Posting Is Too Good to Be True

[If a job seems unrealistically perfect, it probably is](https://www.themuse.com/advice/spot-fake-job-posting).

**Warning signs:**

**High salary for minimal qualifications** - ["$100K+ for entry-level remote work, no experience required!" is bait](https://www.zippia.com/advice/how-to-spot-fake-job-postings/). Real high-paying roles require skills and experience.

**Vague job description** - ["Exciting opportunity for motivated self-starter to earn great income!" doesn't describe actual work](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/spot-fake-job-postings). [Real job postings specify responsibilities, required skills, and what you'll actually be doing](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/write-better-job-descriptions).

**Immediate start date with no interview** - [If the posting says "start immediately" or "hired within 24 hours," it's a scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams). Real hiring processes have multiple stages.

**Generic job title that could mean anything** - ["Customer Success Representative" or "Business Development Associate" at a company you've never heard of posting dozens of identical roles](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/spot-fake-job-postings/). Scammers use generic titles to cast a wide net.

**Poor grammar and spelling** - [If the job posting has obvious typos, grammatical errors, or awkward phrasing, it's likely fake](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/fake-job-posting-warning-signs). Real companies proofread job postings.

## Red Flag #3: The Application Process Is Sketchy

[The application and interview process reveals whether a job is legitimate](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2025/01/job-offer-scams-linkedin).

**Warning signs:**

**Interview via text message, WhatsApp, or Telegram** - [Real companies use Zoom, phone calls, or Microsoft Teams for interviews, not messaging apps](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/fake-job-interview-warning-signs). If a recruiter insists on texting or using WhatsApp, it's a scam.

**They ask for money upfront** - ["Pay for background check," "buy equipment from our vendor," "pay for training materials"—any request for payment is a scam](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams). Real employers pay you, not the other way around.

**They ask for bank account info before you're hired** - ["We need your bank details for direct deposit setup" before you've completed interviews or received an offer is a scam to steal financial information](https://www.identitytheft.gov/scam/job-scam).

**They send you a check and ask you to wire money back** - [Classic scam: They send a fake check for "equipment purchases" and ask you to wire the excess back. The check bounces, your wire is gone](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams).

**The "recruiter" has a brand-new LinkedIn profile** - [Check the recruiter's profile. If it was created in the last few weeks, has few connections, and uses a stock photo, it's fake](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/verify-recruiter-legitimacy).

**You get an offer without a real interview** - [If you "pass" an interview that was just a few text exchanges and immediately receive a job offer, it's a scam](https://www.zippia.com/advice/how-to-spot-fake-job-postings/). Real hiring has multiple rounds and actual conversations.

## Red Flag #4: Ghost Jobs (Real Companies, Fake Hiring)

[Ghost jobs are postings from real companies that have no intention of actually hiring](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ghost-jobs-fake-listings-hiring-f0888a76). [40% of job postings have been open for 30+ days with no activity—many are ghost jobs](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/ghost-jobs-companies-not-hiring).

**Why companies post ghost jobs:**
- [To appear like they're growing (investor optics)](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-posting-fake-jobs-ghost-jobs-2024-5)
- [To collect resumes for future hiring](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ghost-jobs-resume-collection)
- [To gauge market interest before actually opening the role](https://www.ere.net/ghost-jobs-why-companies-post-them/)
- [To make overworked employees think help is coming](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ghost-jobs-employee-morale/)

**How to spot ghost jobs:**

**Job has been posted for 60+ days** - [Real jobs get filled within 30-45 days on average](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/average-time-to-fill-by-industry). If it's been up for months, they're likely not actively hiring.

**Same job reposted every few weeks** - [If a company deletes and reposts the same role repeatedly, it's a ghost job to refresh the posting date](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/05/ghost-jobs-reposted-repeatedly.html).

**Glassdoor reviews mention "always hiring" for that role** - [Check Glassdoor. If employees say "they always have this job posted but never fill it," it's a ghost job](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/spot-ghost-jobs/).

**Company recently announced hiring freeze or layoffs** - [If a company is cutting staff or froze hiring but still has jobs posted, those postings are likely outdated ghost jobs](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/outdated-job-postings-problem).

**Generic "always open" roles** - ["We're always looking for great talent!" postings with no specific role or start date are resume collection, not active hiring](https://www.ere.net/always-hiring-job-postings/).

## Red Flag #5: The Recruiter Is Overly Pushy or Evasive

[Real recruiters are professional and transparent. Scammers are pushy and dodge questions](https://www.themuse.com/advice/recruiter-red-flags).

**Warning signs:**

**Recruiter pressures you to "act fast" or "decide now"** - ["This offer expires in 24 hours!" is a high-pressure scam tactic](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams). Real employers give you time to evaluate offers.

**Recruiter won't answer basic questions** - [If you ask about company size, role responsibilities, or who you'd report to and the recruiter deflects or gives vague answers, something's wrong](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/red-flags-recruiter-outreach/).

**Recruiter can't or won't provide contact info for the hiring manager** - [Real recruiters connect you with hiring managers. Scammers keep you isolated](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/verify-recruiter-legitimacy).

**Recruiter's email domain doesn't match the company** - [If the recruiter claims to work for Google but emails from a Gmail account (recruiter@gmail.com, not recruiter@google.com), it's fake](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams).

## How to Verify a Job Is Legitimate

Before applying or engaging further, do these checks:

**1. Google the company name + "scam" or "reviews"** - [If it's a known scam, someone has posted about it](https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker).

**2. Check the company's actual website** - [Look for a careers page. Does the job you saw on LinkedIn appear on their official website?](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/verify-job-posting-legitimacy) If not, contact the company directly to ask.

**3. Look up the recruiter on LinkedIn** - [Do they have a history, connections, and activity? Or is the profile new with no content?](https://www.linkedin.com/safety/fake-accounts)

**4. Call the company's main number** - [Ask to be transferred to HR. Verify that they're hiring for the role and that the recruiter is legitimate](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams).

**5. Check Glassdoor for reviews and job listings** - [Real companies have employee reviews on Glassdoor. Fake companies don't](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/spot-fake-job-postings/).

**6. Verify the email domain** - [Real recruiters use company email addresses, not Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook](https://www.themuse.com/advice/verify-recruiter-email).

**7. Trust your gut** - [If something feels off, it probably is](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2025/01/trust-your-instincts-job-scams).

## What to Do If You've Been Scammed

[If you've already engaged with a fake job posting](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-you-were-scammed):

**Stop all communication immediately** - Block the recruiter, don't send any more information.

**Report to LinkedIn** - [Flag the job posting and company page as fraudulent](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1338466).

**Report to FTC** - [File a complaint at ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/).

**Monitor your credit and bank accounts** - [If you provided financial or personal information, watch for identity theft](https://www.identitytheft.gov/).

**Don't send money or wire funds** - [If you've been asked to pay for anything, stop immediately. Don't try to "get your money back" by continuing to engage](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams).

## The Bottom Line

[Fake job postings on LinkedIn are common enough that every job seeker needs a verification process](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2025/01/linkedin-job-scams-rise).

**Red flags checklist:**
- New or suspicious company page
- Too-good-to-be-true salary or role
- Interview via text/WhatsApp
- Requests for money or bank info
- Recruiter with brand-new profile
- Job posted for 60+ days (ghost job)
- High-pressure tactics or evasion

**Verification steps:**
- Google the company + "scam"
- Check company website for job listing
- Verify recruiter's identity and email domain
- Call company's main number to confirm
- Trust your instincts

[Don't let desperation override your judgment](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/avoid-job-scams-desperation/). A few minutes of verification can save you from wasting weeks on fake jobs or losing money to scams.

Stay skeptical. Stay safe.

That's the tip. Use it.
