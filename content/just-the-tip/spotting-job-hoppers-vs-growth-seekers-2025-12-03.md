# Red-Flag Job Hoppers vs Ambitious Career Builders

You're reviewing a resume with four jobs in five years. Is this person a flight risk who'll bail after six months, or someone ambitious who's making smart career moves? Here's how to tell the difference.

## The Pattern Matters More Than The Numbers

One-year stints look different in different contexts. Four companies in four years where each move was a promotion into a bigger role with more responsibility? That's career building. Four lateral moves at the same level because they keep having "personality conflicts with management"? That's a problem.

Look for trajectory. Are they moving up, sideways, or just moving?

## The Story They Tell

When you ask about their job history in the interview, listen to how they explain the moves.

**Growth-seeker language**: "I'd maximized what I could learn in that role. The company couldn't promote me to the next level I was ready for, so I found a position that could." Specific, forward-focused, owns their agency.

**Job-hopper language**: "The company changed direction." "Management was a mess." "The role wasn't what they promised." Vague, victim-focused, everything is external.

Everyone has one bad experience where the company was genuinely a disaster. If every company was a disaster, you're looking at a pattern.

## The Details About Growth

Ask what they learned at each position. Growth-seekers can articulate specific skills gained, projects completed, problems solved. They'll tell you how each role built on the last one.

Job hoppers speak in generalities. "I did marketing stuff." "Managed some projects." "Worked with clients." They can't explain what each move added to their skill set because they weren't there long enough to develop anything meaningful.

## Red Flags That Actually Matter

**Short tenures with no size or complexity increase**: If someone moved from 100-person company to 100-person company doing essentially the same role four times, they're not building a career. They're running from something.

**Leaving right after promotion or raises**: Got promoted to senior level, left three months later? That suggests either poor judgment (why accept a promotion you don't want?) or they're using offers to get titles they immediately leverage elsewhere.

**Pattern of departures right after bonus/vest periods**: Calculated career moves are fine, but if someone's entire history is "join in January, leave in February after bonus" repeated across companies, they're optimizing for short-term comp, not long-term value.

**Can't explain any meaningful accomplishments**: Length of tenure matters less than what they did while they were there. If they were somewhere 18 months and accomplished nothing notable, that's worse than being somewhere 10 months and shipping a major project.

## Questions That Reveal The Truth

Skip "where do you see yourself in five years?" Try these instead:

**"Walk me through your career path and what drove each decision."** You're listening for intentionality vs. circumstance.

**"What would your last three managers say was your biggest contribution?"** Growth-seekers can answer this. Job hoppers get vague.

**"What made you start looking for your next role at each company?"** Did they start looking because they'd achieved what they wanted, or because they were unhappy?

**"What's the longest you've stayed anywhere, and why did that one last longer?"** The answer reveals what conditions make them stay.

## The Tech Industry Exception

In tech, especially startups, short stints are more common and less alarming. Companies fail, funding dries up, entire teams get laid off. Two 12-month stints due to startup implosions is different from two 12-month stints leaving established companies.

Ask about the circumstances. If they've survived multiple layoffs or company closures, that's not job hopping - that's bad luck in a volatile industry.

## What You're Really Assessing

You're not trying to find people who stay forever regardless of circumstances. You're trying to avoid people who leave the moment anything gets difficult or boring.

The question isn't "will they stay?" It's "under what conditions will they stay, and can we provide those conditions?"

If someone leaves every time they're asked to do something repetitive or unglamorous, and your role has repetitive unglamorous components, they're a bad fit. If they leave when there's no growth path and you can offer clear growth, they might be perfect.

## The Conversation To Have

Before you rule someone out for short tenures, have a direct conversation: "I see you've moved around fairly frequently. Help me understand what you're looking for in your next role that will make it somewhere you want to stay long-term."

Their answer will tell you everything. If they can articulate specific things about your role, company, or growth path that align with what they're seeking, take them seriously. If they give you generic platitudes about "culture" and "mission," they're probably gone in a year.

## Bottom Line

Job hopping is a pattern, not a number. Two years at each of three companies while climbing from coordinator to director? Fine. Six months at six companies all at the same level? Problem.

Focus on trajectory, intentionality, and what they accomplished during each tenure. The rest is just noise.
