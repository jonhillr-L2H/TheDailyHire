[Personalized recruiter emails get 40-50% response rates while generic templates get 10-15%](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/linkedin-inmails/2023/how-to-improve-inmail-response-rates). The difference? Personalization, specificity, and actually sounding like a human.

Here are email templates that work—but you have to customize them. Copy-paste and you'll get ignored. Add specific details about the candidate and you'll get responses.

## Template 1: The Initial Outreach to Passive Candidates

**Subject: [Specific skill/project] caught my attention**

```
Hi [Name],

I came across your profile and was specifically impressed by [specific project, achievement, or skill they have]. Your work on [specific thing] is exactly the type of experience we're looking for.

I'm recruiting for a [Job Title] role at [Company]—we're [one sentence about what the company does and why it's interesting]. The role involves [2-3 specific responsibilities that align with their background].

Based on your experience with [specific technology/project/skill], I think this could be a strong fit. Comp range is [actual range], and the team is [specific detail about team/culture/tech stack].

Not sure if you're open to exploring opportunities, but worth a conversation either way. Would you be up for a quick 15-minute call this week?

[Your name]
[Title]
[Phone number]
```

**Why this works:**
- References something specific from their profile (shows you actually looked)
- States exactly what the role is and what company (no mystery jobs)
- [Includes salary range upfront](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/passive-candidate-salary-expectations/) (passive candidates won't move without knowing comp)
- Specific ask (15-minute call this week) makes it easy to say yes
- Acknowledges they might not be interested (lowers pressure)

**What to customize:**
- [Specific project/achievement] - Find something from their LinkedIn, GitHub, or portfolio
- [One sentence about company] - Make it compelling and specific, not generic "we're a growing startup"
- [2-3 responsibilities] - Must align with their actual experience

## Template 2: The Follow-Up (If No Response)

**Subject: Re: [original subject line]**

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from [day]—wanted to make sure this didn't get buried in your inbox.

Quick summary: [Job Title] role at [Company], working on [specific interesting project/problem], comp range [range].

If timing isn't right or you're not interested, totally understand. If you are interested, I'd love to chat briefly this week.

Let me know either way!

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Short and to the point
- Restates key details without making them re-read original email
- [Gives them an out if they're not interested](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/09/recruiter-follow-up-how-many-is-too-many.html)
- Doesn't come across as pushy or desperate

**When to send:** 3-4 days after initial email, during business hours Tuesday-Thursday

**When to stop:** If they don't respond after two follow-ups, move on. [Three total touches (initial + 2 follow-ups) is the max](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/09/recruiter-follow-up-how-many-is-too-many.html).

## Template 3: The "We Met at [Event]" Follow-Up

**Subject: Following up from [Event Name]**

```
Hi [Name],

Great meeting you at [event] yesterday! Really enjoyed our conversation about [specific topic you discussed].

I mentioned we're hiring for [role] at [Company], and after talking with you, I think your experience with [specific thing they mentioned] would be a great fit.

The role involves [2-3 key responsibilities]. Comp range is [range], and the team is [specific detail].

Would you be open to a call next week to discuss? I can do [specific day/times].

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- References actual conversation (proves you remember them specifically)
- Connects their experience to the role requirements
- Includes logistics and compensation upfront
- Proposes specific times (easier to say yes than "sometime next week")

## Template 4: The Referral Introduction

**Subject: [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out**

```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual connection] mentioned you might be interested in [type of roles] and suggested I reach out.

I'm recruiting for a [Job Title] at [Company]—we're [what company does]. The role involves [2-3 key responsibilities that match their background].

[Mutual connection] thought your experience with [specific skill/background] would be relevant. Comp range is [range].

Would you be up for a brief call to learn more? Happy to answer any questions.

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Referrals have higher response and conversion rates
- Leading with mutual connection builds immediate credibility
- Still includes all key details (role, comp, company)

**Important:** Make sure you actually got permission from the mutual connection to use their name. Don't fake referrals.

## Template 5: The "Your Work Impressed Me" Approach

**Subject: Your [specific project/article/talk] was excellent**

```
Hi [Name],

I just read your article on [specific topic] / saw your talk at [conference] / came across your project [project name], and it was genuinely impressive—especially [specific detail that stood out].

I'm recruiting for a [Job Title] at [Company], and your perspective on [topic from their work] is exactly what the team needs. We're working on [related problem/project], and I think you'd find the challenge interesting.

Comp range is [range]. The role involves [2-3 responsibilities aligned with their interests/work].

Would you be open to a conversation? Even if timing isn't right, I'd love to stay connected.

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows genuine interest in their work (not just their job title)
- Connects their interests to the role (signals culture fit)
- Acknowledges timing might not be right (keeps door open for future)

**What to customize:**
- [Specific project/article/talk] - Must be real and recent
- [Specific detail] - Reference something specific that impressed you
- [Related problem/project] - Show how the role connects to their interests

## Template 6: The Internal Candidate Notification

**Subject: New opportunity: [Job Title] role**

```
Hi [Name],

We're hiring for a [Job Title] on the [Team Name] team, and based on your experience with [specific skills/projects they've worked on], I think you'd be a strong candidate.

The role involves:
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]

It's a [salary range/level], and you'd be working with [manager name] and the [team].

Internal candidates get priority consideration. Interested in learning more?

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Makes internal candidates feel valued (not an afterthought)
- Connects their current experience to new role
- States that internal candidates get priority (removes fear of external competition)
- Clear next step

## Template 7: The Re-Engagement Email (Past Candidates)

**Subject: New opportunity that's a better fit**

```
Hi [Name],

We spoke [timeframe] ago about the [previous role], and while that wasn't the right fit, a new opportunity just opened that I immediately thought of you for.

[Job Title] at [Company]—working on [specific project/problem]. The difference from last time: [key difference that makes this more relevant].

Comp range is [range]. Based on our previous conversation about [what they were looking for], I think this aligns better with your goals.

Worth a conversation?

[Your name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges previous interaction (shows you keep good records)
- Explains why this is different/better than last time
- References what they were looking for previously (personalized)

## The Elements Every Good Recruiting Email Needs

**Subject line that isn't generic:**
- Bad: "Great opportunity"
- Good: "Senior Engineer role—React + Python focus"

**Specific reference to their background:**
- Bad: "Impressed by your profile"
- Good: "Your open-source contributions to [specific project] caught my attention"

**Actual details about the role:**
- Bad: "Exciting opportunity at a growing company"
- Good: "[Job title] at [Company name], working on [specific project], comp range [$X-$Y]"

**[Salary range included](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/passive-candidate-compensation-conversation):**
- Don't make candidates guess whether it's worth their time

**Clear, specific call to action:**
- Bad: "Let me know if you're interested"
- Good: "Available for a 15-minute call Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon?"

## What NOT to Do

**Don't send novels:** Keep it under 150 words. Passive candidates won't read essays.

**Don't be vague about comp:** [Passive candidates won't waste time without knowing salary range](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/passive-candidate-salary-expectations/).

**Don't use templates without customization:** If you can't find one specific thing about their background to mention, you didn't research enough.

**Don't follow up more than twice:** [Initial email + 2 follow-ups = maximum](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/09/recruiter-follow-up-how-many-is-too-many.html). After that, you're harassing, not recruiting.

**Don't oversell or hype:** "World-changing company" and "rockstar opportunity" make you sound like a used car salesman. Be specific and factual.

## Quick Reference: Email Timing and Best Practices

**Best times to send:**
- Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am or 2-4pm in candidate's time zone
- [Avoid Mondays (inbox chaos) and Fridays (mentally checked out)](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/best-time-to-send-inmails)

**Follow-up schedule:**
- Initial email → wait 3-4 days → Follow-up #1 → wait 4-5 days → Follow-up #2 → stop

**Subject line best practices:**
- Keep it under 50 characters
- Make it specific, not generic
- Reference mutual connections or specific skills when relevant

## The Bottom Line

[Response rates are 3-5x higher when emails are personalized](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/talent-strategy/inmail-personalization-impact). Generic templates get ignored. Customized emails that show you actually looked at their profile get responses.

Use these templates as frameworks, not copy-paste scripts. The 2 minutes you spend researching the candidate and customizing the email will dramatically improve response rates.

That's the tip. Use it.
