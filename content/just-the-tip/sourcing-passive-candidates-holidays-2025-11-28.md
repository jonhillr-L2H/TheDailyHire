# Why Holidays Are Actually Perfect for Sourcing Passive Candidates

Most recruiters take their foot off the gas during holiday weeks because "nobody's looking for jobs right now." Meanwhile, smart recruiters are filling their pipelines with passive candidates who are actually more responsive than usual. Here's why holidays are secretly prime sourcing time.

## The Reduced Competition Window

When 70% of recruiters slow down outreach during Thanksgiving week, your InMails and emails aren't competing with 47 other recruiting messages. Passive candidates who normally ignore recruiter spam actually notice and read messages when their inbox isn't flooded.

This is basic supply and demand. Fewer recruiters reaching out = higher response rates for those who do.

## The Mental Availability Factor

Passive candidates - people employed and not actively job searching - are typically too busy with work to think about career changes. But during holiday weeks? They're coasting. They're catching up on email. They're browsing LinkedIn during downtime.

They're mentally available in ways they aren't during normal work weeks. A well-crafted message that lands when someone has time to actually read it performs better than perfect outreach sent when they're in back-to-back meetings.

## The Year-End Reflection Timing

People reassess their lives during holidays. They're thinking about what they want for next year, whether they're happy in their current role, and what changes they want to make. Your message about an opportunity arrives exactly when they're already in reflective mode.

This isn't manipulation - it's timing. You're reaching out when they're naturally considering "what's next" instead of forcing them to context-switch from their current priorities.

## The Holiday Outreach Strategy

**Timing:** Send messages Tuesday-Thursday of holiday weeks. Avoid actual holidays (don't message people on Thanksgiving Day, obviously), but the surrounding days are golden.

**Tone:** Acknowledge the holiday week without being cute about it.

"Hi [Name], I know it's a holiday week and you're probably winding down before time off, so I'll keep this brief. I'm recruiting for [role] at [company] and your background in [specific skill] caught my attention. Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation in early December to discuss?"

**Keep it short:** Passive candidates during holidays will read three sentences. They will not read your full company pitch. Save the details for when they respond.

**Make the ask clear:** "Would you be open to a conversation?" is better than "I'd love to connect" or other vague networking language. Passive candidates want to know what you want before responding.

## What Actually Works

Personalization matters more during holidays because passive candidates can tell when you've sent 100 identical messages. Reference something specific from their profile or recent work.

Subject lines matter: "Quick question about your [specific experience]" beats "Exciting opportunity!" every time.

Follow-up appropriately: If they don't respond before the holiday break, follow up the week everyone returns. "Following up on my note from before Thanksgiving - any interest in chatting about [role]?"

## The Pushback You'll Get

"But people are on vacation!" Some are. Most aren't. And those who are will respond when they're back if your message was interesting.

"Candidates want to disconnect during holidays!" From work, yes. From career opportunities that could change their trajectory? Not necessarily.

"It seems desperate to recruit during holidays!" Only if you're begging. Professional outreach is professional regardless of when it's sent.

## The Real Advantage

The recruiters who source during holiday weeks build pipelines for January, when hiring kicks into full gear. While everyone else is scrambling to fill Q1 roles with cold outreach, you've got warm candidates already engaged from November conversations.

By the time everyone else starts recruiting in January, you're scheduling second interviews.

Holidays aren't dead zones for recruiting. They're opportunities for recruiters smart enough to work while others coast.

Your move.
