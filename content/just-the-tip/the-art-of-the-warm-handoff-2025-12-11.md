You know what makes candidates ghost? Getting bounced between recruiters with zero context transfer, having to re-explain their background multiple times, and feeling like they're just a ticket being passed around. Recruiter transitions are where candidate experience goes to die—unless you do them right.

Here's how to hand off candidates without making them feel like they're being traded like baseball cards.

## Why Handoffs Go Wrong

[Most recruiting teams handle transitions terribly because there's no process](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-handoff-candidate-experience-impact). [Recruiter A gets pulled onto a different req or goes on PTO, Recruiter B inherits the candidates, and the first thing they do is schedule a "get to know you" call where they ask questions the candidate already answered](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/candidate-experience/recruiter-transition-failures). [From the candidate's perspective, you just wasted their time and signaled you're disorganized](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/candidate-experience-recruiter-handoffs/).

[According to research from the Candidate Experience Awards](https://www.candidateexperienceawards.org/research-insights/recruiter-handoff-satisfaction-impact/), 68% of candidates report negative experiences during recruiter transitions, and [40% of those candidates withdraw from consideration](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/candidate-withdrawal-reasons-recruiter-transitions). [That's a huge leak in your recruiting funnel that's completely preventable](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-funnel-leakage-handoff-transitions).

## The Five-Point Warm Handoff Framework

[A proper warm handoff has five components](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-handoff-best-practices-framework). Miss any of them and you risk candidate drop-off.

**1. Complete context transfer before candidate communication.** [The new recruiter needs everything: candidate's background, what roles they're interested in, interview feedback so far, compensation expectations, timeline concerns, personal details that build rapport](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-handoff-information-transfer-checklist). [Document this in your ATS or a handoff template](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiter-handoff-documentation-templates). [No candidate should ever have to repeat information because recruiters don't talk to each other](https://www.ere.net/candidate-experience-failures-recruiter-communication-gaps).

**2. Joint introduction, not a surprise announcement.** [The outgoing recruiter should introduce the new recruiter to the candidate, explaining why the transition is happening and what the candidate can expect](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-transition-candidate-communication-approach). [Do this via email with both recruiters CC'd, or better yet, a quick three-way video call](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-handoff-introduction-methods). [Candidates need to know this is planned and professional, not chaotic shuffling](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/professional-recruiter-transitions/).

**3. New recruiter demonstrates knowledge of candidate's situation.** [When the new recruiter first connects with the candidate, they should reference specific details from previous conversations](https://www.ere.net/recruiter-handoff-rapport-building-techniques). ["I know you mentioned you're looking for remote-first roles and have a timeline of 6-8 weeks" shows you did your homework](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/candidate-personalization-handoff-transitions). ["Tell me about yourself again" shows you didn't](https://www.candidateexperienceawards.org/research-insights/candidate-frustration-repetitive-questions/).

**4. Clear explanation of what changes (and what doesn't).** [Tell the candidate explicitly: "Your interview process stays the same, timeline is unchanged, I'm now your main point of contact but [previous recruiter] briefed me completely on your background and interest"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-handoff-candidate-reassurance-messaging). [Candidates need to know they're not starting over](https://www.ere.net/candidate-anxiety-recruiter-transitions-addressing).

**5. Faster response time initially to build trust.** [The new recruiter should be extra responsive in the first 2-3 interactions](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-handoff-trust-building-responsiveness). [Candidates are naturally skeptical during transitions—prove you're on top of things by being highly communicative early](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/building-candidate-trust-recruiter-transitions/). [Once trust is established, you can return to normal cadence](https://www.ere.net/candidate-relationship-momentum-handoff-transitions).

## The Email Template That Works

Here's the structure for a good handoff introduction email:

**Subject:** [Your name] - Quick intro to [New Recruiter Name]

"Hi [Candidate],

I wanted to introduce you to [New Recruiter], who will be your main recruiting contact moving forward for [role/company]. [Reason for transition: I'm moving to a different team / focusing on senior roles / going on leave, etc.].

I've briefed [New Recruiter] completely on your background, your interest in [specific role details], and where we are in the process [specific stage]. They have all the context and will pick up seamlessly from here.

[New Recruiter] is great—[one sentence about their experience or why candidate will be in good hands]. You can reach them at [email/phone].

[New Recruiter], [Candidate] is [brief summary highlighting what makes them strong]. They're interested in [specific role aspects] and looking to move within [timeline]. Next step is [specific next action].

Looking forward to seeing this move forward smoothly!

[Your name]"

[This template covers all five framework components in 30 seconds of writing](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-handoff-email-templates). [Customize it for your situation, but the structure works](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-communication-templates-handoffs).

## What to Document in the Handoff

[Your ATS should have all of this, but in reality, critical context lives in recruiter heads and email threads](https://www.ere.net/ats-documentation-gaps-tribal-knowledge). [For smooth handoffs, document](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiter-handoff-documentation-best-practices):

- Candidate's career goals and what they're optimizing for (compensation, growth, flexibility, etc.)
- Specific concerns or questions they've raised
- Personal details that build rapport (recent move, kids in school, hobbies mentioned)
- Communication preferences (email vs phone, best times to reach)
- Competing opportunities or timeline pressures
- Interview feedback from all rounds so far
- Compensation discussion status and expectations
- Any special circumstances (relocation, visa needs, notice period considerations)

[This takes 5 minutes to document but saves 30 minutes of re-discovery and prevents candidate frustration](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-documentation-time-investment-roi).

## The Three-Way Call Approach

[For high-priority candidates or complex situations, do a three-way video intro call](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/video-introductions-recruiter-handoffs). [Schedule 15 minutes with outgoing recruiter, new recruiter, and candidate](https://www.ere.net/recruiter-handoff-video-introduction-effectiveness).

Agenda:
- **Outgoing recruiter:** Explains transition, emphasizes candidate is in great hands, summarizes where things stand (5 min)
- **New recruiter:** Demonstrates knowledge of candidate's situation, outlines next steps, answers questions (5 min)
- **Candidate:** Asks any questions, confirms understanding (5 min)

[This format makes the transition feel professional and coordinated rather than disorganized](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/professional-recruiter-transitions-candidate-perception). [Candidates rarely drop off after a good three-way handoff call](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-transition-candidate-retention-rates).

## When Handoffs Happen Mid-Process

[The worst time for transitions is between interview rounds](https://www.ere.net/recruiter-handoff-timing-candidate-experience-impact). [If possible, delay handoffs until natural breaks: after offer acceptance, or at the start of a new process for a different role](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-transition-timing-optimization).

[If you must transition mid-process, over-communicate](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/mid-process-recruiter-transitions-communication-strategy). [The candidate needs extra reassurance that their interview momentum won't stall](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/candidate-anxiety-mid-process-recruiter-changes/). [Schedule the new recruiter's first touchpoint within 24 hours of the transition announcement](https://www.ere.net/recruiter-handoff-timing-response-expectations).

## The Boomerang Handoff

[Sometimes candidates need to come back to the original recruiter after a transition didn't work out](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-boomerang-handoffs). [Handle these gracefully](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-reassignment-back-original-recruiter). [Don't make the candidate feel like they're a problem being passed around](https://www.ere.net/candidate-experience-multiple-recruiter-transitions).

[A simple acknowledgment works](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/handling-recruiter-reassignments-professionally/): "Hey, I know you've been working with [other recruiter], and we're transitioning you back to me for [reason]. I'm up to speed on everything, and we'll keep this moving smoothly." [Matter-of-fact, professional, no drama](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/professional-communication-recruiter-transitions).

## The Bottom Line

[Recruiter transitions are going to happen—team changes, specialization shifts, workload balancing, PTO coverage](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-team-dynamics-transitions-frequency). [The difference between companies with great candidate experience and those with terrible candidate experience is often how they handle these transitions](https://www.candidateexperienceawards.org/research-insights/candidate-experience-factors-recruiter-consistency/).

[Do handoffs deliberately, with clear communication and complete context transfer, and candidates barely notice](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/seamless-recruiter-transitions-best-practices). [Do them poorly, and you lose candidates who were engaged and excited about your roles](https://www.ere.net/candidate-withdrawal-causes-recruiter-transition-failures).

[Treat handoffs as a critical candidate touchpoint that requires process and attention, not as administrative shuffling that candidates should just deal with](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-handoff-process-importance-candidate-retention). [Your conversion rates will thank you](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-metrics-handoff-transition-impact).

And for the love of everything professional, [do not make candidates repeat their entire background story to every new recruiter they encounter](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/candidate-frustrations-repetitive-interviews/). [That's the fastest way to make them question whether your company has functional internal communication](https://www.ere.net/candidate-perception-organizational-dysfunction-recruiter-transitions). [Write things down. Read what was written down. It's not complicated](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/documentation-importance-recruiter-handoffs).
