You did everything right. Sourced a perfect candidate, navigated the interview process, extended a competitive offer, and they accepted. You're celebrating.

Then the phone rings: **"My current employer just made me a counter-offer. Can we talk?"**

[Counter-offers are the final boss of recruiting](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-acceptance-rates-2025). [70% of candidates who resign receive counter-offers](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-prevalence-2025/), and [40-50% of candidates who accept your offer will seriously consider their employer's counter](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-candidate-consideration-rates/).

Here's how to handle them without losing your candidate—or your sanity.

## Prevent Counter-Offers Before They Happen

**The best counter-offer strategy is addressing it before resignation:**

During the interview process, ask: ["If your current employer made a counter-offer, what would make you still choose to leave?"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-interview-questions/)

[This forces candidates to articulate their reasons for leaving beyond money](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-prevention-interview-techniques/). [When they tell you "lack of growth," "toxic culture," or "no advancement path," reference these reasons later if a counter-offer comes up](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-conversation-framework/).

**When extending the offer, bring it up explicitly:**

["Most candidates receive counter-offers. Let's talk about what you'll do if that happens."](https://www.hrdive.com/news/proactive-counter-offer-discussion-offer-stage/)

[Walk them through the typical counter-offer playbook](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-employer-tactics/): more money, vague promises of promotion, guilt about leaving the team, threats about how resignation looks.

[Help them anticipate and prepare their response before they're emotional and under pressure](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-mental-preparation-candidates/).

## When The Counter-Offer Call Comes

**Stay calm and empathetic:**

["I understand this is a difficult situation. Counter-offers are common and it's natural to consider them. Let's talk through it."](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-recruiter-response-framework/)

[Don't panic, don't guilt-trip, don't immediately counter the counter](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-recruiter-mistakes-avoid/). [Your candidate is stressed—be a partner, not another pressure source](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-candidate-support-approach/).

**Ask what the counter-offer includes:**

["What exactly did they offer you?"](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-details-discovery-questions/)

[Most counter-offers are financial—salary increase, retention bonus, equity](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-component-analysis-2025/). [Some include promotion promises](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-promotion-promise-patterns/). [Many come with emotional appeals about loyalty and team impact](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-emotional-manipulation-tactics/).

[Understanding what they're considering helps you address the right concerns](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-response-strategy-development/).

## Address The Real Reasons For Leaving

**This is where your earlier work pays off:**

["When we first talked, you mentioned you were leaving because of [lack of growth/toxic manager/limited advancement]. Has that changed?"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-original-motivation-reinforcement/)

[Money is rarely the only reason people leave](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/employee-turnover-motivation-research/). [If it was, they'd have negotiated for a raise months ago instead of job searching](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-money-vs-other-factors/).

[Walk them through the reality: "They knew you were unhappy. They could have given you this raise anytime. Why did it take your resignation to get it?"](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-employer-timing-question/)

[Statistics support this: 80% of people who accept counter-offers leave within 6 months anyway because the underlying issues don't change](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-acceptance-retention-rates/).

## Challenge Promotion Promises

**Counter-offers often include vague future promises:**

["They said they're going to promote me to senior manager in three months."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-promotion-promises-validity/)

**Ask the hard questions:**

- ["Did they put that in writing with a specific date and title?"](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-written-commitment-importance/)
- ["Why wasn't this promotion available before you resigned?"](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-promotion-timing-scrutiny/)
- ["What happens if the promotion doesn't materialize? Will you start job searching again?"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-promotion-accountability-questions/)

[Verbal promises made during counter-offers are rarely honored](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-promise-fulfillment-rates/). [Employers say what they need to say to retain you, then deprioritize those commitments once resignation pressure is gone](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-employer-follow-through-failure/).

## Frame The Long-Term Career Impact

**Accepting counter-offers damages your relationship with your employer:**

["You've signaled you're willing to leave. They now see you as a flight risk and will likely look for your replacement."](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-trust-damage-consequences/)

[This isn't theoretical—managers often start succession planning immediately after making counter-offers](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-employer-succession-planning/). [They'll hire or promote someone else as your backup, reducing your advancement opportunities](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-acceptance-career-ceiling/).

["When the next round of layoffs or budget cuts comes, who do you think gets cut first? The loyal employee or the one who tried to leave?"](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-job-security-implications/)

[You've used your resignation as leverage once—you can't do it again](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-future-leverage-loss/). [Your negotiating power is gone](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-negotiation-power-dynamics/).

## Highlight What Your Offer Provides

**Refocus on why they were excited about your opportunity:**

["Let's revisit what attracted you to this role: [new technology, leadership opportunity, company mission, career growth]."](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-original-opportunity-highlighting/)

[Counter-offers address the pain of leaving—your offer should remind them of the excitement of the new opportunity](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-opportunity-comparison-framework/).

["Your current employer is trying to convince you to stay in a situation you already decided wasn't working. We're offering a fresh start with the things you said you wanted."](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-messaging-framing-techniques/)

[Emphasize growth, learning, challenge, culture—the non-financial factors that drive job satisfaction](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-satisfaction-factors-beyond-compensation/).

## Know When To Walk Away

**Sometimes counter-offers reveal candidate motivation you didn't see earlier:**

[If a candidate's entire decision comes down to whoever pays more, they're mercenary and will leave your company for the next highest bidder](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-candidate-motivation-assessment/).

["If money is the only factor, you should probably accept their offer. We want someone who's excited about the opportunity, not just the paycheck."](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-candidate-qualification-filtering/)

[This gives candidates permission to make the decision that's right for them while signaling that you're hiring for fit, not desperation](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-recruiter-positioning-strategy/).

[Better to lose a candidate at the offer stage than hire someone who's already negotiating their exit](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-acceptance-hiring-risk/).

## When Money Is The Only Issue

**If the counter-offer is purely financial and your candidate is otherwise committed:**

["Is compensation the only thing holding you back from joining us?"](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-compensation-only-scenarios/)

[If yes, and they're worth it, consider matching or partially matching](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-compensation-matching-strategy/). [But only if:](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-compensation-matching-criteria/)

✅ Your offer was already at or near market rate
✅ The candidate has demonstrated genuine interest beyond money
✅ They're worth the additional investment
✅ It doesn't create internal equity issues

[Don't get into a bidding war](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-bidding-war-avoidance/). [If your offer was competitive and aligned with their expectations during negotiations, they're either using you for leverage or genuinely conflicted](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-candidate-leverage-identification/).

## Follow-Up After The Conversation

**Give them space to decide without pressure:**

["Take 24 hours to think through everything we discussed. Let's reconnect tomorrow."](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-decision-timeline-management/)

[Rushing them increases anxiety and resentment](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-candidate-pressure-backfire/). [Giving them time shows respect and confidence in your offer](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-decision-space-benefits/).

**Send a follow-up email summarizing your conversation:**

[Recap the original reasons for leaving, the long-term concerns about accepting counter-offers, and the opportunities your role provides](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-follow-up-email-template/). [This gives them something to reference when they're stressed and emotional](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-written-summary-impact/).

## If They Choose The Counter-Offer

**Stay professional and keep the door open:**

["I understand your decision. If things don't work out or circumstances change, please reach out. We'd still love to work with you in the future."](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-acceptance-candidate-relationship-maintenance/)

[80% of people who accept counter-offers regret it within six months](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-acceptance-regret-rates/). [Many will come back to you when the promised promotion never happens or the underlying issues resurface](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-boomerang-candidate-patterns/).

[Keep them in your pipeline and check in every few months](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-acceptance-pipeline-management/).

## If They Choose Your Offer

**Accelerate their start date if possible:**

["The longer the gap between accepting and starting, the more opportunity for doubt or additional counter-offers."](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/post-counter-offer-start-date-acceleration/)

[Get them onboarding paperwork immediately](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-survivor-onboarding-speed/). [Introduce them to their future team via email or video calls before their start date](https://www.hrdive.com/news/pre-boarding-counter-offer-retention/). [Keep them engaged so they don't second-guess their decision](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-post-acceptance-engagement/).

## The Bottom Line

[Counter-offers are emotional, stressful, and common](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/counter-offer-prevalence-management-2025). [Your job is to be a trusted advisor who helps candidates think through the decision rationally](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/counter-offer-recruiter-advisor-role/).

**Prevent them by:**
✅ Discussing counter-offers during interviews
✅ Understanding motivations beyond money
✅ Setting expectations at offer stage

**Handle them by:**
✅ Staying calm and empathetic
✅ Asking about the specifics of the counter
✅ Reinforcing original reasons for leaving
✅ Challenging vague promises
✅ Framing long-term career impact
✅ Highlighting your opportunity's value
✅ Giving space for decision-making

[Most candidates who resist counter-offers do so because you've built a relationship based on trust, helped them see beyond immediate emotion, and reminded them why they wanted to leave in the first place](https://www.hrdive.com/news/counter-offer-resistance-relationship-factors/).

[The candidates you lose to counter-offers weren't fully committed anyway](https://www.talentculture.com/counter-offer-acceptance-commitment-indicator/).
