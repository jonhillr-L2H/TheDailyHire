Your LinkedIn connection request acceptance rate is probably terrible, and you know it. Most recruiters send generic requests that get ignored or rejected because they sound like spam. Here's how to write connection requests that people actually accept, so you can start building relationships instead of collecting rejections.

## Stop Using the Default Message

LinkedIn's default "I'd like to add you to my professional network" is the laziest possible approach. It tells the recipient nothing about who you are or why you're connecting. If you're serious about networking and sourcing, spend the 30 seconds to write a custom note. Every single time.

Candidates receive dozens of connection requests from recruiters weekly. The ones that stand out are personalized, specific, and give a clear reason for connecting. If you can't be bothered to write three sentences, why should they accept?

## Reference Something Specific About Them

The best connection requests mention something from the person's profile or recent activity. "I noticed you just posted about [topic]" or "I saw you worked at [company]—I have connections there too" shows you actually looked at their profile instead of bulk-connecting everyone with a target job title.

Specificity signals genuine interest, not mass outreach. Even something simple like "I see you're in [city]—I'm working with several companies in that market" is better than nothing. You're creating a reason for connection beyond "I want to recruit you eventually."

## Be Honest About Your Intent

If you're a recruiter and you're connecting because someone looks like a potential candidate, just say that. Don't pretend you want to "expand your network" when you really want to pitch them a job. People can tell, and the dishonesty kills trust before you even start.

Try something like: "I'm a recruiter focused on [industry/role]. I'm not reaching out about a specific opportunity right now, but I'd love to connect and stay in touch for future possibilities." That's honest, respectful, and gives them a clear reason to accept or decline. Most people appreciate directness over fake networking pleasantries.

## Keep It Short

Your connection request note has a character limit, and nobody wants to read a novel anyway. Three sentences max. Who you are, why you're connecting, and what (if anything) you're hoping happens next. That's it.

Long, rambling messages feel desperate and get ignored. Short, clear messages feel professional and get accepted. This isn't a cover letter. It's an introduction.

## Don't Pitch in the Connection Request

The connection request is not the place to tell someone about an amazing opportunity. That comes after they accept, if at all. Leading with a job pitch in the connection request is the fastest way to get rejected. People want to know who you are before you start selling them something.

Connect first, build rapport, then—maybe—introduce opportunities when appropriate. If someone's actively job searching, they'll signal that in their profile or content. Otherwise, play the long game. Not every connection needs to turn into a placement this quarter.

## The Reality Check

Most recruiters treat LinkedIn like a numbers game: send 100 connection requests, hope 20 accept, pitch all 20, maybe one responds. That's spam behavior, and it's why your acceptance rate is low. If you want better results, treat connection requests like introductions at a networking event—thoughtful, specific, and human.

Your network is only as valuable as the relationships in it. Bulk connecting with generic messages builds a list of strangers who don't respond to your InMails. Personalized, intentional connection requests build actual relationships with people who might eventually trust you enough to take your call.

Quality over quantity isn't just platitude advice. It's the actual strategy that works. Try it and watch your acceptance rate improve.
