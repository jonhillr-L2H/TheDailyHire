# Managing Up: How to Train Your Hiring Managers to Interview Without Losing Your Mind

Here's an uncomfortable truth: most hiring managers are terrible at interviewing. They ask illegal questions, make snap judgments based on irrelevant factors, let bias run wild, and somehow manage to both under-evaluate strong candidates and over-sell weak ones. And it's your job to fix this without making them feel attacked, undermining their authority, or getting yourself fired.

Welcome to the art of managing up. Here's how to train your hiring managers to interview better without losing your mind (or your job).

## Start with Diagnosis: What Kind of Bad Interviewer Are You Dealing With?

Not all bad interviewers are bad in the same way. You need to diagnose the specific problem before you can fix it.

**The Buddy-Seeker** spends interviews trying to find someone they'd enjoy having lunch with. They over-index on personality fit and under-assess actual skills. They reject qualified candidates for vague "culture fit" reasons that often mask bias.

**The Interrogator** treats interviews like hostile cross-examinations. They ask gotcha questions, intentionally stress candidates, and mistake making people uncomfortable for "testing them under pressure."

**The Rambler** talks for 80% of the interview telling candidates about the role, the team, the company, and themselves. They learn almost nothing about the candidate and then complain that candidates don't ask good questions.

**The Gut-Feeler** makes decisions in the first 90 seconds based on handshake firmness, appearance, or whether the candidate reminds them of someone they know. The rest of the interview is confirmation bias.

**The Resume-Repeater** asks candidates to walk through their resume line by line, learning nothing that wasn't already on paper. They don't probe for depth, context, or skills assessment.

**The Winger** shows up to interviews without preparation, asks random questions without structure, and provides inconsistent evaluation criteria. Their feedback is useless for decision-making.

Identify which type (or combination) you're dealing with, because the coaching approach differs.

## The Foundation: Make It About Outcomes, Not Criticism

Hiring managers get defensive when recruiters tell them they're interviewing wrong. You need to frame training as improving hiring outcomes rather than fixing their deficiencies.

**Instead of:** "Your interviews aren't structured enough and you're letting bias influence your decisions."

**Try:** "I've noticed we're having trouble predicting performance based on interviews. Let's implement a structured approach that research shows improves hiring accuracy by 40%."

**Instead of:** "You talk too much in interviews and don't let candidates speak."

**Try:** "I'm seeing candidates leave interviews without us gathering enough information to evaluate them. What if we use a framework that ensures we learn what we need?"

**Instead of:** "You keep asking illegal questions about family and age."

**Try:** "I want to make sure we're protecting the company from legal risk in interviews. Here's a quick guide on what we can't ask and why."

Frame everything as "we have a shared goal of making better hires, and here's how we get there together" rather than "you're doing it wrong and I need to fix you."

## Strategy 1: Provide Structure Without Seeming Controlling

The best way to improve interviewing is to provide structure that makes it easier for hiring managers to do it well.

**Create interview guides for each role** that include:
- 5-7 specific competencies to assess
- 2-3 questions per competency with follow-ups
- What good/mediocre/poor answers sound like
- How to score each competency

Present this as: "I built this guide to make your interviews more efficient and ensure we're all evaluating the same things." Not: "You need to follow this script because you're bad at this."

**Assign specific assessment areas to each interviewer** so they're not all asking the same questions or covering the same ground. Give the hiring manager the final values/culture fit assessment while other interviewers handle technical skills, collaboration, problem-solving, etc.

This prevents the Rambler from talking about everything and forces the Winger to prepare for a specific evaluation area.

**Implement scorecards with specific criteria** that everyone completes immediately after interviews. Make it easy—5 competencies, 1-5 rating scale, space for evidence-based comments.

Present this as: "This helps us make more objective decisions and remember our impressions when we debrief." Not: "This is to prevent your bias from running wild."

## Strategy 2: Coach Through Debrief Facilitation

The debrief/interview loop is your best coaching opportunity because you can shape the conversation in real-time.

**Start with data, not opinions.** Ask "What specific evidence did you observe?" before "What's your gut feeling?" This trains managers to think in terms of concrete examples rather than impressions.

**Redirect vague feedback.** When someone says "I just didn't connect with them," ask "What specific behaviors or answers led to that feeling?" Make them articulate the underlying reason.

**Surface contradictions.** If one person says the candidate lacks attention to detail and another says they're meticulous, explore: "Those observations seem different—can you both share the specific examples you're basing that on?"

**Name bias when you see it** but attribute it to the group, not individuals: "I notice we're spending a lot of time on where this candidate went to school. Let's refocus on whether they can do the job."

**Summarize using the criteria.** End debriefs by going through each competency and determining whether the candidate meets the bar based on evidence discussed. This reinforces that decisions should be criteria-based.

## Strategy 3: Use Data to Show What's Not Working

Hiring managers respond to data that shows their current approach isn't delivering results.

**Track interview-to-offer conversion rates** by hiring manager. If one manager advances 70% of candidates they interview while another advances 15%, there's an evaluation calibration problem.

**Measure offer acceptance rates** by hiring manager. If candidates are declining offers after interviewing with specific managers, their interview experience is probably terrible.

**Survey new hires** at 90 days about their interview experience. Questions like "Did interviews give you accurate expectations of the role?" and "Did you feel respected and fairly evaluated?" reveal problems.

**Track first-year turnover** by hiring manager. If their hires leave at higher rates, their assessment skills need improvement.

Present this data as: "I'm seeing some patterns that suggest we could improve our process. Here's what I'm thinking..." Not: "Your interviews suck and here's proof."

## Strategy 4: Model What Good Looks Like

Sometimes hiring managers don't know what effective interviewing looks like because they've never experienced it.

**Invite them to observe your screens** to see structured interviewing in action. Afterward, debrief: "Here's why I asked those follow-ups" or "Notice how I probed for specific examples rather than accepting generalizations."

**Record and review interviews** (with candidate permission) during training sessions. Watch 10-minute clips and discuss: "What did we learn here? What questions were most effective? What could we do differently?"

**Share interview guides from other companies** (anonymized) that show structure, competency-based questions, and evaluation rubrics. Sometimes seeing external examples makes it less personal than critiquing their approach directly.

**Bring in external expertise** for interview training. Hiring managers sometimes receive feedback better from outside consultants than from internal recruiters, even when it's the same advice.

## Strategy 5: Address Illegal/Problematic Questions Directly

When hiring managers ask illegal or inappropriate questions, you need to address it immediately but tactfully.

**In the moment (if you're in the interview):** Jump in with a redirect. "Actually, we can't ask about family plans. Let me redirect to..." Then continue. Address it privately later.

**After the fact:** Pull them aside: "I noticed you asked about [topic]. That's legally risky because it could be seen as [discrimination type]. Here's how to get the information you actually need without legal risk."

**Provide alternatives** to illegal questions:
- Instead of "Do you have kids?": "This role requires occasional evening work. Is that schedule feasible for you?"
- Instead of "What country are you from?": "Are you authorized to work in the US?"
- Instead of "How old are you?": "This role requires 5+ years of experience in X. Do you have that?"

**Frame it as risk management:** "I want to protect you and the company from discrimination claims. Here's what we need to avoid and why."

Most managers don't ask illegal questions maliciously—they're just clueless. Education usually fixes it.

## Strategy 6: Create Accountability Without Being Controlling

You need hiring managers to actually implement better practices without micromanaging them.

**Require interview prep meetings** before candidates come on-site. Five minutes to confirm who's assessing what, review the interview guide, and ensure everyone's prepared.

**Make scorecards mandatory** for decision-making. "We can't move forward without completed scorecards from all interviewers" creates accountability.

**Tie your recruitment metrics to their goals.** If hiring manager performance reviews include "time-to-fill" or "quality of hire" metrics, they're incentivized to interview more effectively.

**Celebrate improvements publicly.** When a hiring manager implements structured interviewing and sees better results, share that in team meetings: "Sarah's team cut time-to-fill by 30% using competency-based interviews. Here's what she did."

**Escalate persistent problems.** If a hiring manager consistently refuses to improve and creates legal or quality risk, escalate to their manager or HR. Document the pattern and the business impact.

## Strategy 7: Pick Your Battles

You can't fix everything at once. Prioritize based on risk and impact.

**High priority (fix immediately):**
- Illegal questions or discrimination
- Abusive or disrespectful candidate treatment
- Completely unstructured interviews that produce useless evaluation data

**Medium priority (coach over time):**
- Excessive talking instead of listening
- Weak question quality
- Inconsistent evaluation standards

**Low priority (let it go for now):**
- Minor style differences that don't affect outcomes
- Personality quirks that candidates find charming or neutral
- Preferences for certain question types that still assess skills

You'll burn out and lose credibility if you try to perfect every interviewer. Focus on what meaningfully improves hiring quality and reduces risk.

## The Long Game: Building Interview Culture

Individual coaching matters, but systemic change requires building an interview culture across the organization.

**Run regular interview training** for all people managers, not just when they're hiring. Make it an annual refresh.

**Create an interview working group** of managers who care about hiring excellence. Let them develop best practices, share learnings, and influence peers.

**Recognize and reward good interviewers.** Make "excellent interviewing skills" a leadership competency that's evaluated in performance reviews.

**Share candidate feedback** (anonymized) about interview experiences—both positive and negative. Hearing directly from candidates about what works and what doesn't can be powerful.

**Build interview excellence into onboarding** for new managers. Don't wait until they need to hire—train them before they interview their first candidate.

## The Real Talk: Some Hiring Managers Won't Change

You'll encounter hiring managers who refuse to improve despite coaching, data, and accountability. They're defensive, dismissive, or openly hostile to recruiting input.

You have three options:

**Option 1: Work around them.** Screen candidates more heavily, prep candidates for their quirks, and accept that you'll lose some good people because of their terrible interviewing.

**Option 2: Escalate formally.** Document the problems, the coaching you've provided, the business impact, and escalate to their leadership or HR. This is risky but sometimes necessary.

**Option 3: Refuse to support their hiring.** This is the nuclear option. "I can't ethically support a hiring process that creates legal risk or poor candidate experience. Either we implement these changes or I need to step back from this search."

Option 3 requires political capital and leadership support. Use sparingly.

## Measuring Success: How You Know It's Working

You've successfully trained your hiring managers when:

- Interview debriefs focus on evidence and competencies, not gut feelings
- Candidates report positive interview experiences regardless of outcome
- Hiring managers complete interview prep and scorecards without reminders
- Your offer acceptance rates improve because candidates feel respected
- First-year retention improves because assessment accuracy increases
- You stop hearing illegal or inappropriate questions in interviews

Training hiring managers is a long game. You won't see overnight transformation. But consistent coaching, smart framing, and systematic improvement add up over time.

The goal isn't perfection—it's continuous improvement toward interviews that are fairer, more accurate, more respectful, and more predictive of job success.

And maybe, just maybe, fewer interviews where candidates walk out thinking "What the hell just happened?"

That's the dream. Now get back to coaching that hiring manager who keeps asking candidates about their weekend plans while ignoring their actual qualifications.

You've got this. Probably.
