Resume fraud is having a moment. [A recent survey found 78% of candidates admit to "embellishing" their resumes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-embellishment-survey-2025), and [background check companies report a 43% increase in discrepancies between stated and actual employment history](https://www.hireright.com/blog/background-screening-trends-2025).

Translation: people are lying more, and they're getting better at it.

Here's how to spot fake job experience before you waste time interviewing fabricators.

## Red Flag #1: Vague Job Titles With No Context

**What it looks like:** "Business Development Specialist" or "Marketing Consultant" or "Technology Strategist" with no company name or minimal description.

**Why it's suspicious:** [Generic, inflated titles often hide unemployment, gig work, or freelance projects the candidate is trying to pass off as full-time employment](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/resume-job-title-inflation-patterns-2025).

**How to verify:** [Ask specific questions about the role](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-verification-questions-fake-experience/): "Who did you report to?" "What was your team structure?" "Walk me through your typical day."

[Fake roles fall apart under scrutiny](https://www.hrdive.com/news/resume-fraud-interview-detection-2025/). [Real jobs have bosses, coworkers, processes, and details](https://www.talentculture.com/authentic-job-experience-indicators/).

## Red Flag #2: Suspiciously Round Dates

**What it looks like:** Every job starts in January and ends in December. Or experience listed as "2020-2023" without specific months.

**Why it's suspicious:** [Candidates hiding short tenures use round dates to obscure gaps](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-employment-date-manipulation/). ["2020-2021" could mean 2 years or 2 weeks if they started December 2020 and left January 2021](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/resume-date-ambiguity-red-flags/).

**How to verify:** [Request month-and-year dates for all positions](https://www.hrdive.com/news/employment-verification-date-precision/). [If they can't provide them, that's your answer](https://www.talentculture.com/resume-date-verification-techniques/).

[Background checks reveal actual start and end dates](https://www.hireright.com/blog/employment-verification-date-discrepancies). [If "2020-2022" turns out to be "June 2021-August 2021," you've caught a lie](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/background-check-employment-fraud-detection/).

## Red Flag #3: Accomplishments That Can't Be Verified

**What it looks like:** "Increased revenue by 350%" or "Led team of 47 people" or "Launched product that generated $12M in first year."

**Why it's suspicious:** [Candidates know you can't easily verify quantitative claims](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/resume-accomplishment-inflation-prevalence/). [They inflate numbers knowing most recruiters won't dig deeper](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-metric-fabrication-trends/).

**How to verify:** [Ask how they measured it](https://www.hrdive.com/news/interview-accomplishment-verification-questions/): "How did you calculate that revenue increase?" "What was the baseline?" "Who else on your team contributed to that result?"

[Fake accomplishments collapse when you ask for methodology](https://www.talentculture.com/resume-metric-interview-validation/). [Real ones come with details about measurement, attribution, and team involvement](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/authentic-accomplishment-verification-indicators/).

## Red Flag #4: Companies That Don't Exist Or Can't Be Found

**What it looks like:** Obscure company names with no online presence, websites that don't work, or LinkedIn pages with 2 employees.

**Why it's suspicious:** [Candidates create fake companies or list failed startups to fill employment gaps](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/fake-company-employment-fraud/). [Others claim to have "consulted" for companies that never existed](https://www.hrdive.com/news/resume-fake-employer-detection/).

**How to verify:** [Google every company listed on the resume](https://www.talentculture.com/resume-employer-verification-checklist/). [Check LinkedIn for the company page and other employees who worked there](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/employer-verification-recruiting). [If you can't find evidence the company existed when the candidate claims to have worked there, dig deeper](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/employer-existence-verification-methods/).

[Ask for a reference from that company](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-fake-employer-detection/). [If they can't provide one, that's telling](https://www.hrdive.com/news/reference-availability-resume-fraud-indicator/).

## Red Flag #5: Education Credentials That Don't Add Up

**What it looks like:** Degrees from unaccredited institutions, graduation years that don't align with work history, or advanced degrees listed without undergraduate degrees.

**Why it's suspicious:** [Education fraud is rampant—diploma mills sell fake degrees, and candidates list "some college" as actual degrees](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diploma-mill-fraud-employment-2025). [Others claim degrees they started but never finished](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/education-verification-incomplete-degrees/).

**How to verify:** [Request transcripts for any role requiring specific education](https://www.hrdive.com/news/education-verification-best-practices-recruiting/). [Verify degree conferral dates with the institution](https://www.nscverifications.org/). [Google the school name plus "accredited" to confirm legitimacy](https://www.ed.gov/accreditation/database-accredited-institutions).

[Be especially suspicious of online degrees from names you've never heard of](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/diploma-mill-identification-guide/). [Legitimate online programs come from recognized universities](https://www.talentculture.com/legitimate-online-degree-verification/).

## Red Flag #6: LinkedIn Profile Doesn't Match Resume

**What it looks like:** Job titles differ, dates don't align, accomplishments vary between the two.

**Why it's suspicious:** [Candidates often update resumes to embellish experience but forget to update LinkedIn, creating inconsistencies](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/linkedin-resume-discrepancy-patterns/). [Or they test different versions of their story and lose track of what they told whom](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/resume-linkedin-consistency-verification/).

**How to verify:** [Pull the LinkedIn profile and compare it side-by-side with the resume](https://www.hrdive.com/news/resume-linkedin-cross-reference-recruiting/). [Note discrepancies and ask about them in the interview](https://www.talentculture.com/interview-questions-resume-linkedin-conflicts/): "Your resume says you were VP of Sales, but LinkedIn says Sales Manager—which is correct?"

[Watch how they respond](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-response-pattern-dishonesty-detection/). [Honest mistakes are explained easily; fabrications require scrambling](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/interview-deception-response-patterns/).

## Red Flag #7: Overqualified Candidates With Perfect Resumes

**What it looks like:** Senior-level candidate applying for mid-level roles with flawless credentials and zero red flags.

**Why it's suspicious:** [Sometimes this is legitimate—career change, relocating, seeking less stress](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/overqualified-candidate-motivations/). [But it can also be completely fabricated experience designed to game past ATS filters and recruiter screens](https://www.hrdive.com/news/fake-overqualified-resume-fraud-patterns/).

**How to verify:** [Ask why they're pursuing a lower-level role](https://www.talentculture.com/overqualified-candidate-interview-questions/). [Probe their most recent experience deeply](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/interview-recent-experience-verification/). [Request references from their last two roles, not just the impressive one from five years ago](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-recent-employment-focus/).

[Overqualification fraud often involves listing senior roles from years ago (real or fake) while obscuring recent unemployment or underemployment](https://www.hrdive.com/news/resume-fraud-overqualification-patterns/).

## Red Flag #8: Gaps Filled With "Consultant" Or "Freelancer"

**What it looks like:** Extended periods of "independent consulting" or "freelance work" with no specific clients or deliverables mentioned.

**Why it's suspicious:** ["Consulting" is the resume euphemism for "I was unemployed but don't want to admit it"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/resume-consulting-employment-gap-concealment/). [Not always—plenty of people legitimately freelance—but it's often a cover story](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/freelance-consulting-verification-challenges/).

**How to verify:** [Ask for client names, project descriptions, and references](https://www.hrdive.com/news/freelance-experience-verification-methods/). [Real consultants can provide details](https://www.talentculture.com/authentic-freelance-experience-indicators/). [Fake ones will dodge or provide vague answers](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/freelance-fraud-interview-detection/).

[Ask to see work samples or portfolio items](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/portfolio-verification-freelance-claims/). [If they "can't share due to NDAs" for every project, that's suspicious](https://www.hrdive.com/news/nda-excuse-freelance-verification-red-flag/).

## Red Flag #9: References Who Are "Unavailable" Or Hard To Reach

**What it looks like:** Candidate provides references but they never respond to your outreach, or all references are personal cell phones with no company affiliation.

**Why it's suspicious:** [Fake references are easy to set up—friends or family posing as former managers](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/fake-reference-fraud-detection/). [If references are unresponsive or provide generic praise without specific details, they might not be real](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/reference-check-fraud-indicators/).

**How to verify:** [Look up references on LinkedIn and verify they actually worked at the company during the candidate's tenure](https://www.hrdive.com/news/reference-verification-linkedin-cross-check/). [Call companies directly and ask to be connected to the reference](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-check-direct-contact-methods/) rather than using the phone number the candidate provided.

[Ask detailed questions that only someone who actually managed the candidate would know](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-detailed-questions-fraud-detection/): "What was their biggest challenge in the role?" "How did they handle conflict with team members?"

## Red Flag #10: AI-Generated Resume Content

**What it looks like:** Resumes that sound overly polished, use perfect grammar and buzzwords, but lack specific details or personality.

**Why it's suspicious:** [Candidates are using ChatGPT to write entire resumes](https://www.hrdive.com/news/ai-generated-resume-prevalence-2025/). [The result: generic, keyword-optimized content that sounds impressive but says nothing specific](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/ai-resume-detection-patterns/).

**How to verify:** [Look for specificity](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-authenticity-specificity-indicators/). [Real experience includes details—project names, coworker names, specific challenges, measurable outcomes](https://www.talentculture.com/authentic-resume-experience-characteristics/). [AI-generated content is vague and generic](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/ai-generated-vs-authentic-resume-comparison/).

[In interviews, ask candidates to elaborate on resume bullet points](https://www.hrdive.com/news/interview-resume-elaboration-verification/). [If they struggle to expand on their own resume content, it might not be their content](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ai-resume-interview-verification/).

## What To Do When You Catch A Lie

**During the interview:** [Ask clarifying questions without directly accusing them](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/interview-deception-confrontation-techniques/). ["I'm seeing some discrepancies between your resume and LinkedIn—can you walk me through your exact title and dates at Company X?"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-discrepancy-interview-questions/)

[Give them a chance to explain or correct](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-mistake-vs-fraud-determination/). [Honest mistakes happen—titles get misremembered, dates blur together](https://www.talentculture.com/resume-error-vs-fraud-differentiation/). [But intentional fraud typically involves defensive responses or story changes](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/interview-fraud-response-patterns/).

**If it's clearly fabrication:** [End the process](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/terminating-interview-fraud-discovery/). ["Thank you for your time, but we've identified inconsistencies that make us unable to move forward."](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-rejection-fraud-communication/)

[Document what you found in case they apply again](https://www.talentculture.com/resume-fraud-documentation-procedures/). [Don't publicly shame them—just don't hire them](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/resume-fraud-ethical-response/).

## The Bottom Line

[Resume fraud is increasing because the job market is competitive and candidates feel pressure to stand out](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-fraud-trends-2025). [Your job is to verify before you hire, not assume everything on a resume is true](https://www.hrdive.com/news/resume-verification-responsibility-recruiters/).

**Look for:**
✅ Vague job titles with no details
✅ Round or ambiguous employment dates
✅ Unverifiable accomplishments and metrics
✅ Companies that don't exist or can't be confirmed
✅ Education credentials that don't check out
✅ LinkedIn-resume discrepancies
✅ Suspiciously perfect overqualified candidates
✅ "Consulting" used to hide unemployment gaps
✅ References who can't be verified
✅ Generic, AI-generated content without specifics

[Trust but verify](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/trust-but-verify-recruiting-philosophy/). [Ask detailed questions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/detailed-interview-questions-verification/). [Run background checks](https://www.hireright.com/solutions/background-screening). [Contact references directly](https://www.talentculture.com/reference-check-best-practices-2025/).
