[LinkedIn users share an average of 3-5 articles per week](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/content-sharing-statistics). It feels productive—you're staying active, curating useful content, showing you're engaged with your industry.

But here's the problem: [sharing others' content barely moves the needle for your visibility or credibility](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/original-vs-shared-content-performance).

[Original content (posts written by you) gets 10x more engagement and 7x more profile views than reshared articles](https://www.hootsuite.com/research/linkedin-content-performance-2025). Recruiters and hiring managers don't discover you through shared links—they discover you through your original insights, perspectives, and expertise.

Here's the data on what actually gets you noticed, and how to balance original content with strategic sharing.

## The Cold Hard Numbers: Original vs. Reshared

[LinkedIn's algorithm heavily favors original content over reshares](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/linkedin-ads/linkedin-algorithm-content-types):

**Original posts (text, images, videos):**
- Average reach: 8-12% of your network
- Average engagement rate: 3-5%
- Profile views generated: 15-25 per post

**Reshared articles (with or without commentary):**
- Average reach: 2-3% of your network
- Average engagement rate: 0.5-1%
- Profile views generated: 2-5 per post

[Translation: One original post drives as much visibility as 5-10 reshared articles](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-original-content-algorithm-boost/643893/).

**Why the algorithm favors original content:**
[LinkedIn wants to keep users on the platform](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/linkedin-ads/linkedin-algorithm-user-retention). When you share external links, you're directing people away from LinkedIn. When you post original content, people stay and engage on LinkedIn.

[The algorithm rewards content that keeps users engaged on-platform](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-algorithm-how-it-works/643891/).

## What Counts as "Original Content"

[Original content is anything created by you, posted natively on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/original-content-definition):

**Text posts** - Your thoughts, insights, reflections, or commentary (no external links)

**Image posts** - Screenshots, infographics, photos with your commentary

**Video posts** - Short videos uploaded directly to LinkedIn (not YouTube links)

**Document posts** - PDFs or slide decks uploaded to LinkedIn

**LinkedIn articles** - Long-form posts published using LinkedIn's article feature

**Polls** - Questions with voting options (great for engagement)

**What's NOT original content:**
- Resharing articles from external sites
- Reposting others' LinkedIn content
- Sharing YouTube links or blog posts

[Even if you add your own commentary to a shared article, LinkedIn's algorithm treats it as a reshare, not original content](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/link-posts-algorithm-penalty).

## The Problem with Resharing

[Resharing feels safe because you're not putting your own ideas out there—you're just curating](https://www.themuse.com/advice/linkedin-content-strategy-original-vs-shared). But that safety comes at a cost:

**You're promoting someone else's brand, not yours** - [When you share an article, the author gets credit and visibility, not you](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/sharing-vs-creating-content).

**It signals you're a curator, not a creator** - [Recruiters and hiring managers want to see your thinking, not your ability to find articles](https://www.ere.net/linkedin-content-strategy-job-seekers/).

**It doesn't differentiate you** - [Hundreds of people are sharing the same trending articles. You blend into the noise](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/linkedin-original-content-job-search/).

**The algorithm punishes it** - [Shared links get significantly less reach because LinkedIn doesn't want to send users off-platform](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/linkedin-ads/linkedin-algorithm-link-penalty).

[Job seekers who only reshare content get 70% fewer profile views than those who post original insights](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/job-search/original-content-recruiter-visibility).

## How to Turn Resharing into Original Content

If you find an article worth sharing, don't just click "Share." [Turn it into original content by writing your own take](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/article-commentary-strategy):

### Strategy 1: Write a Reaction Post (No Link)

**Instead of sharing the article, post your reaction:**

**Bad (Reshare):**
> "Great article on remote work trends. [External link]"

**Good (Original Post):**
> "Just read an interesting stat: 72% of companies now offer hybrid work, up from 45% in 2023.
>
> My take: Hybrid is the new default, but most companies are still figuring out the logistics—how many days in-office, which meetings require in-person, who covers costs.
>
> What's your company's hybrid policy? Working? Not working?"

[You referenced the article but created original commentary—this performs 10x better](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/turn-links-into-original-posts).

### Strategy 2: Extract Key Insights and Add Your Perspective

**Instead of linking to a 2,000-word article, summarize the key points and add your take:**

**Example:**
> "Three trends I'm seeing in [your industry]:
>
> 1. [Trend from article] - This matters because [your insight]
> 2. [Trend from article] - My experience: [personal example]
> 3. [Trend from article] - Prediction: [your forward-looking take]
>
> What are you seeing in your work?"

[This positions you as someone who synthesizes information and forms opinions—much more valuable than just sharing links](https://www.themuse.com/advice/linkedin-thought-leadership-strategy).

### Strategy 3: Challenge or Build On the Article's Argument

**If you disagree or want to add nuance, create a counter-post:**

**Example:**
> "Everyone's talking about [topic] after [article/news]. But here's what they're missing:
>
> [Your perspective or additional context]
>
> The reality is more nuanced than the hot takes suggest."

[Thoughtful disagreement or expansion shows critical thinking—this is what recruiters and hiring managers notice](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/recruiting-tips/candidates-who-think-critically).

## The 80/20 Rule for LinkedIn Content

[If you want to maximize visibility and build your brand, follow this ratio](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/content-mix-strategy):

**80% original content:**
- Your insights, reflections, and commentary
- Projects you're working on
- Skills you're learning
- Career updates and lessons learned
- Questions and discussions

**20% strategic sharing:**
- Reshare content from your target companies (signals interest to recruiters)
- Reshare posts from industry leaders (especially if you add thoughtful commentary as a comment)
- Amplify content from your network (builds relationships)

[The 80/20 rule ensures you're building your brand while staying connected to your industry](https://www.hootsuite.com/research/linkedin-content-strategy-80-20-rule).

## What Original Content Actually Looks Like

**Example 1: Industry Insight**
> "Just hit 5 years as a product manager. Here are 3 things I wish I'd known on day one:
>
> 1. [Insight with brief explanation]
> 2. [Insight with brief explanation]
> 3. [Insight with brief explanation]
>
> What would you add?"

**Why this works:** [Personal experience + actionable insights + question to drive engagement](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/experience-based-posts-performance).

**Example 2: Project Showcase**
> "Spent the last month building [project description]. Here's what I learned:
>
> Challenge: [Specific problem]
> Approach: [How you solved it]
> Result: [What happened]
>
> Tech stack: [Tools/skills used]
>
> Open to feedback or questions!"

**Why this works:** [Shows what you can do, not just what you say you can do](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/recruiting-tips/candidates-showcase-work).

**Example 3: Career Reflection**
> "Two months into my job search. Three things I've learned:
>
> 1. [Specific insight]
> 2. [Specific insight]
> 3. [Specific insight]
>
> To everyone else in the job search—what's surprised you most?"

**Why this works:** [Authentic, relatable, and opens conversation](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/job-search/authentic-posts-engagement).

## How to Create Original Content When You "Don't Have Anything to Say"

[The biggest excuse for not posting original content: "I don't have anything interesting to say."](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/linkedin-original-content-ideas/) Here's how to fix that:

**Turn daily work into content:**
- Problem you solved this week
- Lesson learned from a project
- Tool or technique you tried for the first time

**React to industry news:**
- Don't just share the article—post your take
- What does this news mean for your role or industry?
- Do you agree or disagree with the consensus take?

**Share what you're learning:**
- New skill or certification you're working on
- Course or book that's been valuable
- Concept that changed how you think about your work

**Ask questions:**
- Crowdsource advice or recommendations
- Run polls on industry topics
- Start discussions about challenges in your field

[You don't need groundbreaking insights—you need consistency and authenticity](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/consistency-over-perfection).

## Tracking What Works

[After 2-4 weeks of posting original content vs. sharing, check your LinkedIn analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/linkedin-analytics-guide):

**Compare:**
- Impressions (how many people saw your post)
- Engagement rate (likes + comments + shares / impressions)
- Profile views in the 24 hours after posting

[Original content will consistently outperform reshares by 5-10x](https://www.hootsuite.com/research/linkedin-content-performance-2025).

## The Bottom Line

[Sharing others' content feels productive but doesn't build your brand or increase your visibility](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/content-marketing/original-vs-shared-content-performance). [Original content gets 10x more engagement and 7x more profile views](https://www.hootsuite.com/research/linkedin-content-performance-2025).

**The strategy:**
- 80% original content (your insights, experiences, projects)
- 20% strategic sharing (target companies, industry leaders, network amplification)
- Turn articles into reaction posts instead of just resharing links
- Focus on consistency over perfection

[Job seekers who post original content regularly are 5x more likely to attract recruiter attention](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/job-search/original-content-recruiter-visibility) than those who only share links.

You have something to say. Start saying it.

That's the tip. Use it.
