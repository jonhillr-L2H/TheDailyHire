Let's cut the BS: most phone screens are bloated time-wasters where recruiters ask the same boring questions that tell them nothing useful. [Research shows the average phone screen takes 35-45 minutes](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/phone-screen-best-practices), and half of that time is completely wasted on pleasantries and redundant questions you could've answered by reading the resume.

I've done thousands of phone screens, and I can tell you exactly what you need to know in 15 minutes. Here are the only five questions that matter.

## Question 1: "Walk me through why you're looking to leave your current role."

**Why it works:** [This question immediately reveals motivation, red flags, and whether they're actually serious about making a move](https://www.ere.net/phone-screen-questions-motivation/).

**What to listen for:**
- Vague answers = not actually looking, just testing the market
- Trash-talking current employer = will do the same to you in a year
- Clear, specific reasons (growth, new challenges, comp, location) = legitimate candidate
- Enthusiasm about your opportunity specifically = strong signal

**Red flag answers:** "Just seeing what's out there" or "My boss is terrible" or anything that suggests they haven't really thought through why they'd leave.

## Question 2: "What's your salary expectation for this role?"

**Why it works:** [No point dancing around compensation. If you're not aligned here, nothing else matters](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/salary-negotiation-phone-screen/).

**How to ask it:** Be direct. "This role is budgeted at $X-Y range. Does that work for you?" If they deflect or say "I'm flexible," push for a number. [Candidates who won't name a range are either wildly outside your budget or playing games](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/salary-expectations-conversation).

**What to listen for:**
- Clear range that overlaps with yours = proceed
- Way above your budget = politely end the call
- "I need to know more about the role first" = fair, but circle back to this before ending

## Question 3: "What's your timeline for making a move? Are you interviewing anywhere else?"

**Why it works:** [This tells you urgency and competitive pressure](https://recruitingdaily.com/candidate-timeline-and-competing-offers/).

**What to listen for:**
- "I'm in final rounds at 2 other companies" = move fast or lose them
- "Just starting to look" = longer timeline, less urgency
- "I have an offer pending" = you're probably too late unless you can move immediately
- "Not interviewing anywhere else yet" = good position, but verify why (are they selective or are they not getting responses?)

**Pro move:** [If they're in process elsewhere, ask what companies and what roles](https://www.ere.net/competitive-intelligence-phone-screens/). This gives you competitive intelligence and helps you position your opportunity.

## Question 4: "Tell me about a time you [insert key skill for the role]. What was the situation and what did you do?"

**Why it works:** [Generic "tell me about yourself" questions are useless. Behavioral questions about specific skills give you real signal](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/behavioral-interview-questions-phone-screens).

**How to customize it:**
- Engineering role: "Tell me about a technically complex project you've led"
- Sales role: "Walk me through your process for closing a difficult deal"
- Management role: "Describe a time you had to deliver tough feedback to a direct report"

**What to listen for:**
- Specific examples with details = they actually did the thing
- Vague generalities = they're bullshitting or lack depth
- Can't think of an example = major red flag for a "required" skill

## Question 5: "What questions do you have for me about the role or company?"

**Why it works:** [The questions candidates ask tell you everything about their priorities and how seriously they're taking this opportunity](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/candidate-questions-quality-signal).

**What to listen for:**
- Thoughtful questions about team structure, growth, challenges = engaged and strategic
- Only asking about PTO, hours, remote policy = priorities are questionable
- No questions at all = not interested or not prepared
- Questions that show they researched the company = strong signal

**Red flag questions:** "So, what does your company do?" (they didn't even look at your website) or "What's the salary range?" when you already covered it.

## The Structure That Works

Here's how to run this in 15 minutes:

**Minutes 0-2:** Quick intro, set expectations. "I've got about 15 minutes to give you an overview and ask a few questions. Sound good?"

**Minutes 2-5:** Question 1 (motivation) + Question 2 (salary). [If either of these is a dealbreaker, you can end here and save everyone time](https://www.ere.net/efficient-phone-screens/).

**Minutes 5-8:** Question 3 (timeline) + Question 4 (skill validation).

**Minutes 8-12:** Quick pitch on your role and company. [Keep it tight—highlight what makes this opportunity compelling for their specific situation](https://recruitingdaily.com/selling-the-role-phone-screen/).

**Minutes 12-15:** Question 5 (their questions) + next steps.

## What You Don't Need To Ask

Stop wasting time on these questions that tell you nothing:

❌ "Tell me about yourself" - [You can read their resume. Ask specific things](https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/phone-screen-questions-to-avoid).

❌ "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" - Nobody knows and this isn't 1987.

❌ "What's your greatest weakness?" - [Everyone's practiced the fake-weakness answer. It's useless](https://www.askamanager.org/2023/04/greatest-weakness-question-needs-to-die.html).

❌ "Why do you want to work here?" - You haven't even sold them on the opportunity yet. Save this for later rounds.

## The Bottom Line

[Phone screens should be quick qualification conversations, not mini-interviews](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/phone-screen-efficiency). You need to know: Are they actually looking? Is comp aligned? What's their timeline? Can they do the job? Are they interested?

These five questions get you all of that in 15 minutes. [Everything else is noise that belongs in later interview rounds](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/interview-process-efficiency).

Stop scheduling hour-long phone screens. Respect your time and the candidate's time. [Get the information you need efficiently and move strong candidates to the next stage quickly](https://www.ere.net/speed-wins-recruiting-2025/).

That's the tip. Use it.

**The 5 Questions:**

1. Why are you looking to leave your current role?
2. What's your salary expectation for this role?
3. What's your timeline? Are you interviewing elsewhere?
4. Tell me about a time you [key skill for role]
5. What questions do you have for me?

**Time allocation:** 15 minutes total. Motivation + salary first (dealbreakers). Skill validation middle. Candidate questions + close at the end. That's it.
