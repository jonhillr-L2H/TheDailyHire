Phone screens are awkward. You're calling a stranger, interrupting their day, and asking them to talk about themselves under pressure. [Most candidates enter phone screens defensive and guarded](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-phone-screen-anxiety-research-2025).

The first 30 seconds determine whether the call feels like a conversation or an interrogation. [Get the opening right, and candidates relax, open up, and actually engage](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/phone-screen-rapport-impact-candidate-performance/). [Get it wrong, and you'll spend 20 minutes pulling information from someone who wants the call to end](https://www.hrdive.com/news/phone-screen-rapport-failure-outcomes/).

Here's how to build instant rapport that makes phone screens productive and pleasant.

## The Wrong Way To Start

**What doesn't work:**

❌ **"Let me tell you about the role..."** [Starting with a 5-minute monologue kills energy before the candidate says a word](https://www.talentculture.com/phone-screen-monologue-engagement-loss/).

❌ **"Walk me through your resume."** [This is boring, impersonal, and makes candidates feel like you didn't prepare](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/phone-screen-resume-walk-through-candidate-perception/).

❌ **Launching straight into screening questions.** ["What's your salary expectation?" as your second sentence feels transactional](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/phone-screen-screening-question-timing-rapport/).

❌ **Being overly formal or corporate.** ["Good morning. This is [Full Name] from [Company Legal Entity]. I'm calling regarding position requisition #47392."](https://www.hrdive.com/news/phone-screen-formality-candidate-comfort/) Nobody talks like this. Don't start like this.

[These openings signal that you're checking boxes, not having a conversation](https://www.talentculture.com/transactional-phone-screen-candidate-experience/). [Candidates respond with equally robotic, rehearsed answers](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/phone-screen-candidate-response-patterns/).

## The Right Way: Energy + Warmth + Context

**A great opening includes three elements in 30 seconds:**

1. **Energy:** [Match or slightly exceed the energy you want from the candidate](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/phone-screen-energy-matching-rapport-building/)
2. **Warmth:** [Show you're a human talking to another human, not a gatekeeper](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-warmth-candidate-openness-correlation/)
3. **Context:** [Briefly explain why you're calling and what to expect](https://www.talentculture.com/phone-screen-agenda-setting-candidate-comfort/)

**Example opening:**

["Hey [Name], this is [First Name] from [Company]—thanks so much for making time for this call. I know phone screens can feel formal, but I'm just hoping to have a quick conversation about your background and the role we're hiring for. I've got about 20 minutes—does that still work for you?"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/phone-screen-opening-script-examples/)

**Why this works:**

✅ ["Hey" is warmer than "Hello"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/greeting-formality-rapport-research/) (adjust based on your industry and culture)
✅ [Using first names only makes it conversational](https://www.hrdive.com/news/name-usage-professional-rapport-building/)
✅ [Thanking them for their time shows respect](https://www.talentculture.com/gratitude-candidate-phone-screen-impact/)
✅ [Acknowledging that phone screens can be awkward disarms tension](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/acknowledging-interview-anxiety-rapport/)
✅ [Setting expectations (20 minutes, conversation format) reduces uncertainty](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/phone-screen-expectation-setting-anxiety-reduction/)
✅ [Confirming timing shows you respect their schedule](https://www.hrdive.com/news/schedule-confirmation-candidate-respect-signals/)

## Technique #1: Start With Smalltalk (Really)

**After your opening, spend 30-60 seconds on non-work conversation:**

["How's your day going so far?"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/smalltalk-phone-screen-rapport-effectiveness/)

["I see you're in [City]—how's the weather there? We're getting buried in snow here."](https://www.talentculture.com/location-based-smalltalk-phone-screen/)

["Did I catch you at a good time, or should we reschedule?"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/timing-consideration-phone-screen-rapport/)

[This feels unprofessional to some recruiters, but research shows brief smalltalk reduces candidate anxiety and increases openness](https://www.hrdive.com/news/smalltalk-professional-conversation-anxiety-research/).

[You're signaling: "This is a conversation between humans, not a formal evaluation"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/humanizing-phone-screen-opening/).

**How long should smalltalk last?** [30-60 seconds, then transition](https://www.talentculture.com/smalltalk-duration-phone-screen-optimization/). [Any longer and you seem unprofessional; any shorter and it feels perfunctory](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/smalltalk-timing-balance-recruiting/).

## Technique #2: Acknowledge Something Specific From Their Background

**Show you actually reviewed their profile:**

["I saw you worked on [specific project]—that's really impressive."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/personalized-recognition-phone-screen-rapport/)

["Your background in [specific skill] is exactly what we're looking for."](https://www.hrdive.com/news/skill-recognition-candidate-validation-phone-screen/)

["I noticed you transitioned from [Industry A] to [Industry B]—I'd love to hear about what drove that."](https://www.talentculture.com/career-transition-conversation-starter-phone-screen/)

[Specificity proves you prepared and makes candidates feel valued, not like one of 50 calls you're making this week](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/preparation-signals-candidate-respect/).

[Generic compliments ("great background!") sound fake](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/generic-vs-specific-recognition-authenticity/). [Specific recognition ("your work on the AWS migration project") feels genuine](https://www.hrdive.com/news/specific-accomplishment-recognition-candidate-engagement/).

## Technique #3: Explain Why You're Excited To Talk To Them

**Candidates want to know why you reached out:**

["I came across your profile and your experience with [specific skill/company] stood out because we're solving similar problems here."](https://www.talentculture.com/sourcing-motivation-explanation-phone-screen/)

["Your background is a great fit for what we're building—I wanted to connect and see if the timing might work."](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/fit-explanation-candidate-interest-generation/)

["I've been looking for someone with your mix of [Skill A] and [Skill B], which is surprisingly rare—so I was excited when I found your profile."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/unique-fit-explanation-candidate-flattery/)

[This positions them as valuable and in-demand, not as someone being screened out](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-positioning-phone-screen-psychological-impact/). [It's subtle flattery that makes people more receptive](https://www.talentculture.com/flattery-recruiting-effectiveness-research/).

## Technique #4: Give Them Control Early

**Ask what they want to know before diving into questions:**

["Before I jump into questions, what would be most helpful for you to understand about the role or company?"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/candidate-question-priority-phone-screen-engagement/)

[This flips the power dynamic](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/power-dynamics-phone-screen-rapport/). [Instead of being interrogated, candidates feel like partners in the conversation](https://www.hrdive.com/news/collaborative-phone-screen-approach-candidate-experience/).

[Most candidates will say "let's start with your questions" anyway, but asking shows respect](https://www.talentculture.com/candidate-control-phone-screen-respect-signals/).

## Technique #5: Use Their Name (But Not Too Much)

**Say their name 2-3 times during the call:**

["[Name], can you tell me more about..."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/name-usage-frequency-rapport-building/)

["That's great, [Name]—so what happened next?"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/name-repetition-conversation-engagement/)

[Using someone's name activates attention and creates subconscious connection](https://www.hrdive.com/news/name-usage-psychological-rapport-effects/). [But overuse sounds creepy and salesy](https://www.talentculture.com/name-overuse-recruiting-authenticity-loss/).

[2-3 times in a 20-minute call is optimal](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/name-usage-frequency-optimization-research/).

## Technique #6: Match Their Communication Style

**Pay attention to how they talk and mirror it:**

[If they're formal: maintain professionalism](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/communication-style-matching-rapport-building/).

[If they're casual: loosen up and be conversational](https://www.hrdive.com/news/formality-matching-phone-screen-comfort/).

[If they give short answers: ask open-ended questions to draw them out](https://www.talentculture.com/communication-adaptation-phone-screen-technique/).

[If they ramble: gently redirect with structure ("That's helpful—let me ask about...")](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/conversation-direction-phone-screen-control/).

[Mirroring communication style builds subconscious rapport](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/mirroring-technique-recruiting-psychology/). [Candidates feel "heard" when you communicate in their style](https://www.hrdive.com/news/communication-mirroring-candidate-comfort-research/).

## Technique #7: Smile (Yes, On The Phone)

**Smiling changes your vocal tone:**

[Research shows people can "hear" smiles through the phone](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/vocal-warmth-phone-screen-research/). [Your voice sounds warmer, friendlier, and more energetic when you smile](https://www.talentculture.com/smiling-vocal-tone-phone-communication/).

[Keep a mirror at your desk as a reminder](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/phone-screen-environment-setup-tips/). [Sounds silly, but it works](https://www.hrdive.com/news/smiling-phone-sales-recruiting-effectiveness/).

## Technique #8: Acknowledge If You're Running Late

**If you're calling late:**

["Hey [Name], I'm so sorry I'm a few minutes late—I got stuck on a previous call. Thanks for your patience."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/apology-timing-candidate-respect/)

[Acknowledging lateness shows respect](https://www.talentculture.com/punctuality-apology-professional-rapport/). [Ignoring it makes you seem oblivious or dismissive of their time](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-lateness-candidate-perception/).

## Technique #9: Transition Smoothly Into Questions

**After rapport-building, transition explicitly:**

["Thanks for that context. Let me ask you a few questions about your background, and then I'll tell you more about the role and what we're looking for. Sound good?"](https://www.hrdive.com/news/phone-screen-transition-statement-clarity/)

[Explicit transitions reduce awkwardness](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/conversation-transition-techniques/). [Candidates know what to expect and when the "screening" portion begins](https://www.talentculture.com/phone-screen-structure-candidate-comfort/).

## What Not To Do

❌ **Over-apologize:** ["Sorry for taking your time, sorry if this is inconvenient, sorry for..."](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/excessive-apology-confidence-perception/) Stop. One acknowledgment is respectful; multiple apologies signal insecurity.

❌ **Complain about your day:** ["I've been on calls all morning and I'm exhausted."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-complaint-candidate-perception-impact/) Candidates don't care and it makes you seem unprofessional.

❌ **Joke about recruiting challenges:** ["You're one of 500 people I'm calling this week, haha!"](https://www.hrdive.com/news/volume-recruiting-candidate-value-perception/) This makes them feel like a number, not a priority.

❌ **Ask if they're still interested before explaining the role:** ["Are you still looking for jobs?"](https://www.talentculture.com/premature-interest-qualification-phone-screen/) Let them understand the opportunity before asking if they want it.

## The First Impression Window

[Research shows first impressions form in 7 seconds of interaction](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/first-impression-formation-speed-research/). [On phone calls, it's even faster because there are no visual cues](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/phone-first-impression-timing/).

[Your tone, energy, and word choice in the first 30 seconds set the entire call's trajectory](https://www.hrdive.com/news/phone-screen-opening-call-outcome-correlation/).

[Candidates who feel rapport in the first minute are more likely to:](https://www.talentculture.com/early-rapport-candidate-behavior-outcomes/)
- Answer questions thoroughly and honestly
- Ask substantive questions about the role
- Express genuine interest in the opportunity
- Move forward in the process
- Accept offers if extended

[Candidates who don't feel rapport in the first minute are more likely to:](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/poor-rapport-candidate-behavior-patterns/)
- Give short, guarded answers
- Not ask questions
- Drop out of the process later
- Accept other offers even if yours is competitive

**30 seconds of rapport-building isn't wasted time—it's the most productive 30 seconds of the call.**

## The Bottom Line

[Phone screens don't have to be painful](https://www.hrdive.com/news/phone-screen-candidate-experience-improvement/). [The first 30 seconds determine whether candidates relax and engage or remain guarded and transactional](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/phone-screen-opening-candidate-engagement-correlation/).

**Build instant rapport by:**

✅ Opening with energy, warmth, and clear context
✅ Spending 30-60 seconds on genuine smalltalk
✅ Acknowledging something specific from their background
✅ Explaining why you're excited to talk to them
✅ Giving them control by asking what they want to know
✅ Using their name 2-3 times during the call
✅ Matching their communication style
✅ Smiling (yes, even on the phone)
✅ Transitioning smoothly into screening questions

[Master the opening, and the rest of the phone screen becomes easy](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/phone-screen-rapport-performance-correlation/). [Candidates open up, share details, ask real questions, and actually get excited about your opportunity](https://www.talentculture.com/phone-screen-rapport-candidate-enthusiasm/).

[Blow the opening, and you'll spend 20 minutes pulling information from someone who wants the call to end](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/poor-phone-screen-opening-recovery-difficulty/).

**30 seconds. That's all you've got. Make them count.**
