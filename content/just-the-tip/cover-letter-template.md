[Let me be real with you: 90% of cover letters are garbage](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-quality-statistics). [They're either generic templates that could apply to any job, or rambling autobiographies that nobody asked for](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/common-cover-letter-mistakes).

[But when done right, a good cover letter can get you an interview even when your resume alone wouldn't](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-interview-rate-impact). Here's the formula that actually works.

## The Formula: Problem, Solution, Proof, Action

**Paragraph 1: Hook + Why This Role**
[First sentence grabs attention](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-opening-lines). [Second sentence shows you actually read the job posting and understand what they need](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/demonstrating-job-understanding).

**Example:**
"[When I saw that you're looking for someone to rebuild your content strategy from scratch, I literally said 'that's my dream project' out loud](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/enthusiasm-authentic-expression). [I've done exactly this twice before—at Company A where I grew organic traffic 300% in 18 months, and at Company B where I built their content program from zero to their top lead source](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/relevant-accomplishment-opening)."

[Notice what this does: shows genuine interest + immediately demonstrates relevant experience](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-immediate-relevance).

**Paragraph 2: Specific Relevant Accomplishment**
[Pick ONE achievement that directly relates to their biggest need](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/targeted-accomplishment-focus). [Tell a mini-story with a problem, your solution, and measurable results](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/star-method-cover-letter).

**Example:**
"[At Company A, I inherited a blog that was getting 5,000 monthly visitors and zero leads](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/starting-point-context). [I rebuilt the entire content strategy around SEO research and audience pain points, created a repeatable production process, and trained the team on optimization best practices](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/action-steps-narrative). [Within 18 months, we were at 60K monthly visitors and content became our #2 lead source, generating 200+ qualified leads per month](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/quantified-results-impact)."

[One detailed story beats three vague claims every time](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/depth-over-breadth-cover-letters).

**Paragraph 3: Why This Company**
[Show you actually researched them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/company-research-cover-letter). [Not generic "great company culture" BS, but specific things that connect to your experience or interests](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/specific-company-interest).

**Example:**
"[I've been following your company since you launched the AI-powered analytics feature last year](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recent-company-developments-mention). [What you're building for mid-market companies is exactly the kind of product I want to help grow—complex enough to be interesting, practical enough to drive real business value](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/product-alignment-interest). [Plus, I saw your CEO's interview about building thoughtfully instead of chasing every trend, and that philosophy aligns perfectly with how I approach content strategy](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/values-alignment-cover-letter)."

[This shows you did your homework and you're not just mass-applying](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/personalized-application-indicators).

**Paragraph 4: Clear Call to Action**
[Don't end with weak sauce like "I look forward to hearing from you](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/weak-cover-letter-closings)." [End with confidence and a next step](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/confident-cover-letter-closing).

**Example:**
"[I'd love to talk about how I can help rebuild your content program and turn it into a revenue driver](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/value-proposition-closing). [I'm happy to share the detailed playbook I used at Company A, or walk through the specific strategy I'd recommend for your situation](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/offering-value-upfront). [When's a good time for a conversation?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/actionable-closing-question)"

[Confident, specific, gives them a reason to respond](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/compelling-call-to-action).

## The Complete Template

[Here's the whole thing put together](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/effective-cover-letter-template-example):

---

Dear [Hiring Manager Name - find it on LinkedIn if it's not listed],

[Hook sentence showing enthusiasm for the specific role]. [I've done exactly this at Company A and Company B, where I [relevant accomplishment]](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/immediate-credibility-establishment).

[At Company A, specific challenge/situation]. [What I did about it with concrete actions]. [Measurable results with numbers](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/quantified-achievement-storytelling).

[I've been following your company because of specific recent thing]. [What excites me about your product/mission/approach]. [How my experience aligns with your goals](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/alignment-demonstration).

[I'd love to talk about specific value I can bring]. [Offer of something tangible]. [Clear next step question](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/strong-cover-letter-conclusion)?

[Your Name]

---

[Total length: 250-350 words](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/ideal-cover-letter-length). [Reads in under 2 minutes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-reading-time). [Tells them exactly why you're qualified and why you care](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-purpose-fulfillment).

## What Makes This Work

**It's specific.** [No generic "I'm a hard-working professional" nonsense](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/avoiding-generic-cover-letter-language). [Actual companies, actual numbers, actual results](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/specificity-credibility).

**It's about them, not you.** [You're not giving your life story](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-focused-vs-company-focused). [You're explaining how you solve their problems](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/problem-solving-orientation).

**It shows you did research.** [You know what they do, what they need, and why you fit](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/research-demonstrates-interest).

**It's confident without being arrogant.** ["Here's what I've done and here's how I can help you" hits different than "please consider me"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/confidence-vs-desperation).

## When You Actually Need a Cover Letter

**Always include one if:**
- [It's requested in the job posting](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/following-application-instructions)
- [You're making a career change and need to explain how your skills transfer](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/career-change-cover-letter-necessity)
- [You have an unusual background that needs context](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/explaining-unusual-backgrounds)
- [You have a connection at the company or relevant context to mention](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/leveraging-connections-cover-letter)

**Skip it if:**
- [The application system makes it super difficult to upload](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/application-system-obstacles)
- [It's a high-volume role where they're clearly not reading them (retail, food service, etc.)](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-relevance-by-role-type)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't rehash your resume.** [Your cover letter tells stories your resume can't](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-vs-resume-content).

**Don't address it "To Whom It May Concern."** [Find a name. Use LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/finding-hiring-manager-name). ["Dear Hiring Manager" is acceptable if you absolutely can't find one](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-salutation-best-practices).

**Don't start with "I'm writing to apply for..."** [They know why you're writing. Start with something interesting](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/avoiding-obvious-openings).

**Don't apologize for lack of experience.** ["I know I don't have all the requirements, but..." is an instant no](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/negative-framing-cover-letter). [Focus on what you DO have](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/positive-framing-qualifications).

**Don't use the same letter for every job.** [The whole point is personalization](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/customization-cover-letter-effectiveness). [If you're mass-applying, don't use cover letters at all—they're doing more harm than good](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/generic-cover-letter-backfire).

## The Bottom Line

[A good cover letter takes 30-45 minutes to write properly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-time-investment). [Use this time wisely—only for roles you actually want and that match your experience](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/strategic-cover-letter-use).

[When you do write one, use this formula: problem, solution, proof, action](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-formula-summary). [Keep it under 350 words. Make it specific to them. Show you did your homework](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-checklist).

[Do this right and your cover letter becomes your best marketing tool](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cover-letter-as-marketing-document). [Do it wrong and you're better off not sending one at all](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/bad-cover-letter-worse-than-none).

[Choose wisely](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/strategic-application-approach).
