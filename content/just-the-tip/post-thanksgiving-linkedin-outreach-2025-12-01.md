# Post-Thanksgiving LinkedIn Outreach: Why This Week Has Highest Response Rates

Every recruiter thinks December is slow for outreach. They're wrong. The first two weeks of December - specifically right after Thanksgiving - consistently show the highest InMail and connection request response rates of the entire year. Here's why, and how to capitalize before the window closes.

## The Long Weekend Psychology

Candidates just spent four days away from work, which means they spent four days thinking about whether they actually like their jobs. Family members asked about their careers, they scrolled LinkedIn while avoiding relatives, and they had time to reflect on whether they're happy professionally.

This creates a window where candidates are more open to career conversations than usual. They haven't fully re-engaged with their current roles yet, the new year feels close enough to make changes realistic, and they're in evaluation mode. Strike now while they're still in that mindset.

Research shows job search activity spikes 40% the week after Thanksgiving compared to the week before. Candidates are actively looking or passively open. Your InMail arriving Monday or Tuesday hits when they're most receptive.

## Lower Competition, Higher Visibility

Most recruiters slow down outreach in December, which means your messages face less competition. The average professional receives 60% fewer recruiting messages in early December compared to September or October when everyone's trying to close Q3/Q4 reqs.

This means your carefully crafted InMail doesn't get buried under 15 other recruiter messages. It stands out. Candidates actually read it instead of batch-deleting recruiting spam. Response rates reflect this - early December InMails see 25-30% response rates compared to 15-20% during peak recruiting months.

The recruiters who understand this are quietly filling their January pipelines while their competitors are coasting into the holidays. Be the recruiter who gets responses, not the one complaining about December being slow.

## The Right Message For Right Now

Your standard outreach template will fail this week. Candidates are in a different mindset post-Thanksgiving. They're thinking about new beginnings, fresh starts, and New Year's resolutions - use that psychology.

Frame your message around January opportunities: "I know it's early December, but the best roles for January fill in the next two weeks. Wanted to reach out before the holiday chaos hits." This acknowledges the timing while positioning your outreach as strategic rather than random.

Avoid aggressive urgency. Candidates are open to conversations but they're not making immediate moves during December. Your goal is to start a dialogue, get them interested, and schedule calls for mid-December or early January. Plant seeds now, harvest in January.

## Personalization Matters More Than Ever

Generic spray-and-pray outreach already sucks, but it's especially bad this week. Candidates who are evaluating their careers are looking for specific reasons to consider your role. "Great opportunity for someone with your background" gets ignored. "I saw you built X at Company Y and we're solving similar challenges with Z technology" gets responses.

Spend 3-4 minutes researching each candidate before reaching out. Check their recent posts, look at their project history, find a genuine connection point. The extra time investment pays off in response rates - personalized messages get 3x higher response rates than templates.

Also, acknowledge the timing: "I know reaching out the week after Thanksgiving is unconventional, but I wanted to catch you before December gets crazy." This shows awareness and creates rapport instead of pretending it's a normal week.

## Target Passive Candidates Aggressively

Active job seekers are already applying to everything. They don't need your outreach. The real opportunity this week is passive candidates who aren't actively looking but are open to the right conversation.

These are people who've been at their current company 2-4 years, haven't updated their LinkedIn recently, and aren't engaging with job content. They spent Thanksgiving weekend thinking "maybe I should look around" but haven't done anything about it yet. Your message is the nudge they need.

Use connection requests instead of InMails for passive candidates. InMails feel transactional and recruiter-y. Connection requests with personalized notes feel like genuine networking. Once they accept, you've got an open channel to start conversations without burning InMail credits.

## The Two-Week Window

This response rate advantage lasts exactly two weeks - December 1st through December 15th. After December 15th, candidates mentally check out for the holidays and response rates crater. You've got 14 days to fill your pipeline.

Send your highest-priority outreach Monday-Wednesday this week while candidates are back at work but not yet overwhelmed. Follow up with second-tier candidates Thursday-Friday. Next week, repeat with different target segments.

Track response rates daily. If you're not seeing 25%+ response rates to personalized InMails this week, your messaging is off. Test different angles - new year opportunities, Q1 projects, team growth, whatever resonates with your specific candidate pool.

## Set Up January Success Now

The candidates who respond this week become your January pipeline. Don't try to close them in December unless they're actively looking. Instead, focus on relationship building: "Let's schedule a call for January 3rd to discuss. I'll send calendar options closer to the holidays."

This reduces pressure, shows respect for their holiday schedule, and keeps them engaged without forcing immediate decisions. Come January 2nd, you've got a pipeline of warm candidates ready for conversations while other recruiters are starting cold outreach from scratch.

The recruiters who win in Q1 are the ones who spent early December planting seeds. Everyone else shows up January 2nd with empty pipelines wondering why hiring is so hard. Don't be everyone else.
