[You got a job offer. Congratulations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-offer-evaluation-process). [Now comes the part where most people make terrible decisions because they only look at the salary number and ignore everything else](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/salary-tunnel-vision-mistake).

[Let me save you from six months of regret](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/job-offer-evaluation-mistakes).

## Create a Scorecard (Seriously)

[Don't keep this in your head. Write it down](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/job-offer-comparison-framework). [Make a spreadsheet or use paper, I don't care, just make it visual so you can actually compare offers objectively](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/job-offer-evaluation-framework).

[Rate each category 1-10, then weight them by importance to YOU](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/weighted-decision-matrix-job-offers).

## Category 1: Total Compensation (Not Just Salary)

[This is where people screw up](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/total-compensation-evaluation). [They see "$90K salary" and stop reading](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/salary-only-evaluation-error). [Calculate the full package](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/calculating-total-compensation):

**Base salary:** [The obvious one](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/base-salary-considerations)

**Bonus potential:** [Is it realistic or fantasy?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/realistic-bonus-expectations) [Check Glassdoor to see what people actually receive](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/researching-bonus-payout-rates)

**Equity/stock options:** [If it's a startup, this is basically lottery tickets. If it's a public company, this is real money](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/equity-compensation-valuation). [Use an equity calculator to understand actual value](https://www.levels.fyi/equity-calculator/)

**401(k) match:** ["Company matches 6%" is literally free money](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/retirement-match-value). [Calculate the annual value](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/401k-match-comparison)

**Health insurance:** [Compare premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/health-insurance-comparison-job-offers). [A $5K higher salary means nothing if health insurance costs you $8K more per year](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/healthcare-cost-total-comp-impact)

**PTO:** ["Unlimited PTO" usually means less PTO than a set amount](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/unlimited-pto-reality). [Check Glassdoor reviews for the reality](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/unlimited-pto-actual-usage)

**Other perks:** [Commuter benefits, phone stipend, home office budget, professional developmentâ€”add it all up](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/calculating-benefits-value)

## Category 2: Growth Potential

**Can you actually advance here?** [Ask about internal promotion rates. Check LinkedIn to see if people get promoted or leave to move up](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/internal-mobility-research).

**Professional development budget:** [Do they invest in your growth or expect you to figure it out yourself?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/learning-development-support)

**Skill development:** [Will you learn things that make you more marketable, or will you stagnate?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/role-skill-building-assessment)

**Mentorship and coaching:** [Is there someone who can actually help you grow, or are you on your own?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/mentorship-availability-evaluation)

## Category 3: Work-Life Balance (The Real Version)

[Don't just ask "is there work-life balance?" Everyone says yes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/work-life-balance-claims-vs-reality). [Dig deeper](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/assessing-real-work-life-balance):

**Actual work hours:** [What time do people start and end? Check Slack timestamps or email send times if you can](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/observing-work-hours-culture)

**PTO usage:** [When was the last time someone took a week-long vacation? Do people actually disconnect?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/pto-utilization-culture-indicator)

**After-hours expectations:** [Are evening/weekend messages expected to be answered immediately?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/after-hours-communication-norms)

**Remote/hybrid policy:** [What's the actual policy vs. what they say in the interview?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/remote-work-policy-reality)

**Commute:** [If you're going to office, factor in commute time AND cost](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/commute-quality-of-life-impact). [That $5K salary bump might not be worth an extra 90 minutes in traffic daily](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/commute-compensation-tradeoff)

## Category 4: Team and Management

[This might be the most important category](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/manager-quality-job-satisfaction). [A great manager makes a mediocre job bearable. A terrible manager makes a great job miserable](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/manager-impact-job-satisfaction).

**Your direct manager:** [Did you connect with them? Do they seem competent? What's their management style?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/manager-evaluation-interview)

**The team:** [Did they seem engaged and happy, or exhausted and checked out?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/team-energy-assessment)

**Turnover:** [Check LinkedIn. If everyone has been there less than a year, that tells you something](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/team-tenure-linkedin-research)

**Support:** [Will you have the resources and support to actually succeed, or will you be set up to fail?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/resource-adequacy-evaluation)

## Category 5: Company Stability and Culture

**Financial health:** [Is the company stable, growing, shrinking, or about to implode?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/company-financial-stability-assessment) [If it's a startup, what's their runway?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/startup-financial-health-evaluation)

**Mission and values:** [Do you actually care about what they're building, or is it just a paycheck?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/mission-alignment-job-satisfaction) [Caring about your work makes a huge difference in long-term satisfaction](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/meaningful-work-importance)

**Culture fit:** [Can you be yourself here, or will you be code-switching and pretending every day?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/authentic-self-workplace)

**Glassdoor and reviews:** [What are people actually saying? Look for patterns in negative reviews](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/employer-brand/glassdoor-review-analysis)

## Category 6: Job Content and Challenge

**Is the work actually interesting?** [Don't take a job just for money if you'll be bored out of your mind](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-engagement/job-interest-retention-impact)

**Right level of challenge:** [Too easy and you'll stagnate. Too hard and you'll be overwhelmed](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/challenge-level-job-satisfaction). [Find the Goldilocks zone](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/optimal-challenge-employee-development)

**Autonomy vs. structure:** [Do you need freedom or guidance? Make sure the role matches your work style](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/work-style-role-fit)

**Impact:** [Will you actually move the needle, or are you a cog in a giant machine?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-engagement/meaningful-impact-work)

## How to Actually Use This

[Rate each category 1-10 for each offer you're considering](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/job-offer-scoring-system). [Weight them based on what matters most to you right now](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/personal-priorities-job-selection):

- [Early career? Weight growth potential heavily](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/early-career-priorities)
- [Have kids? Work-life balance probably matters more than compensation](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/parent-work-life-priorities)
- [Burned out? Maybe stability and culture trump everything else](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/burnout-recovery-job-selection)
- [Need money NOW? Total comp is your priority](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/financial-priority-job-decision)

[Your priorities are your priorities. Just be honest about what they are](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/authentic-priority-assessment).

## The Red Flag Check

[Before you accept, do one final check](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/final-offer-evaluation-checklist):

- [Does anything feel off in your gut?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/trusting-instinct-job-offers)
- [Are there multiple red flags you're ignoring because of the salary?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/overlooking-red-flags-compensation)
- [Would you take this job if it paid 10% less? If not, that's data](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/money-only-motivation-warning)
- [Can you see yourself here in 2 years? If not, why are you saying yes?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/long-term-fit-consideration)

## The Bottom Line

[The "best" job offer isn't always the highest-paying one](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/best-job-offer-definition). [It's the one that best matches what YOU need right now](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/personal-fit-over-prestige).

[A $10K salary increase means nothing if you're miserable, learning nothing, and planning your escape after 6 months](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/short-term-thinking-job-selection). [Total compensation, growth potential, work-life balance, good management, and interesting work all matter](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/holistic-job-evaluation).

[Take the time to evaluate offers properly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/thorough-offer-evaluation-importance). [This decision affects where you spend 40+ hours per week](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/job-decision-life-impact). [You can afford to be thoughtful about it](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/taking-time-decide-offers).

[And if you realize you made the wrong choice? It's okay to keep looking](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/correcting-job-decision-mistake). [Better to find the right fit than stay somewhere wrong out of obligation](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/leaving-wrong-job-choice).
