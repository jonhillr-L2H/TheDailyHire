It's December 22nd. Half your team is already on vacation. Hiring managers stopped responding to emails on December 15th. But you've still got open positions, budget decisions pending, and data that needs cleaning before January 1st.

Here's what to actually prioritize in the next week when you only have 40% of your normal capacity and everyone's mentally checked out already.

## Close or Extend Your Open Reqs

[Companies have approved positions and budget that expires at year-end](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/). [If they don't hire now, they lose that headcount allocation](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/).

**Review every open position:**
- Can it realistically close before December 31st? If yes, push hard to finish.
- If no, extend the req into Q1 2026 and update target close dates.
- For positions that won't convert, document why so you can justify headcount budget in 2026.

[Many companies have use-it-or-lose-it headcount to fill](https://medium.com/@Elijah.A/land-your-dream-job-during-the-holidays-why-december-is-peak-hiring-season-bd1043039e2c). [Finance teams don't carry empty positions into Q1—they reallocate those resources](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/). If you don't want to lose budget, extend those reqs formally now.

## Clean Your ATS Data

Your ATS is a mess. Candidates marked "interview scheduled" from October who already declined offers. Pipeline stages that don't reflect actual status. Notes that were never added. Fix it now while you have downtime.

**Quick ATS cleanup:**
- [Update all candidate statuses to reflect reality](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/best-recruitment-analytics-software/)
- Close out old requisitions that filled months ago but weren't marked complete
- Archive candidates who ghosted or declined but are still sitting in your pipeline
- [Add notes to promising candidates so you remember context in January](https://recruitcrm.io/blogs/recruitment-analytics-tools/)

[Analytics are only as good as the data feeding them](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/best-recruitment-analytics-software/). [If your ATS data is inaccurate, your 2025 recruiting reports will be wrong](https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/tools/best-recruitment-analytics-software/).

Clean data now means accurate year-end reports and reliable 2026 planning.

## Document Your 2025 Metrics

Finance and leadership want recruiting reports in January. Don't scramble then—pull the data now while you still remember what happened.

**Key metrics to capture:**
- [Time-to-hire, cost-per-hire, source of hire, and candidate conversion rates](https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/tools/best-recruitment-analytics-software/)
- [Quality of hire based on performance reviews and retention data](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/best-recruitment-analytics-software/)
- [Which sourcing channels delivered the best candidates](https://recruitee.com/reporting)
- [Where candidates dropped off in your pipeline](https://www.manatal.com/blog/recruitment-dashboard)

[Track quality of hire, retention rates, and business impact](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/best-recruitment-analytics-software/)—not just efficiency metrics. Executives want to know if recruiting drove business results, not just how fast you filled positions.

## Secure Your 2026 Budget

[43% of employers plan to hire more people in the first quarter of 2026](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/). That hiring requires budget for recruiting tools, job postings, agencies, and assessments.

**Confirm your 2026 allocations:**
- Do you have headcount budget approved for Q1 hiring?
- [Are your recruiting software contracts renewing or do you need to renegotiate?](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/08/3201460/0/en/After-an-Unpredictable-Year-Recruiters-Foresee-Big-Tech-Changes-in-2026-Says-Research-from-Employ-Inc.html)
- [Do you have budget for job board postings and sourcing tools?](https://www.recruitics.com/recruitment-analytics-)

[76% of talent acquisition teams are considering major technology updates in 2026](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/08/3201460/0/en/After-an-Unpredictable-Year-Recruiters-Foresee-Big-Tech-Changes-in-2026-Says-Research-from-Employ-Inc.html). If you're planning tech upgrades, confirm budget allocation now before finance locks 2026 spending plans.

## Build Your Q1 2026 Hiring Pipeline Now

[December hiring is actually efficient because there's less competition and motivated candidates](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire). [While everyone else waits until January, smart recruiters are sourcing now](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire).

**Pipeline building during holidays:**
- [Post jobs now—candidate application volume is down 20-25%, so your postings get more visibility](https://www.greatbaystaffing.com/job-blog/2025/12/16/why-december-might-be-the-secret-weapon-month-for-job-seekers-while-everyone-else-is-hibernating)
- [Reach out to passive candidates who aren't flooded with recruiting messages right now](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/)
- [Source candidates for January start dates while competition is low](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)

[Companies that build strong teams now will be ready when business picks up in Q1](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/) rather than scrambling to staff up while simultaneously hitting revenue targets.

## Communicate Hiring Plans With Managers

Hiring managers disappear during holidays. Get clarity on Q1 priorities before everyone vanishes.

**Quick manager check-ins:**
- Which Q1 positions are highest priority?
- Are job descriptions current or do they need updates?
- What interview availability looks like in January (people burn PTO in January too)
- [Whether they want to start sourcing now or wait until January](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)

[Coordinating interview schedules during holidays is challenging](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire), but you need to know manager availability for early January so you can schedule efficiently.

## Review Your Recruiting Tech Stack

[82% of recruiters are satisfied with their current tech stack, but 76% are considering major updates in 2026](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/08/3201460/0/en/After-an-Unpredictable-Year-Recruiters-Foresee-Big-Tech-Changes-in-2026-Says-Research-from-Employ-Inc.html). Year-end is the time to evaluate what's working and what needs to change.

**Tech stack audit:**
- Which tools did your team actually use consistently in 2025?
- [Which platforms have contracts renewing in Q1?](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/08/3201460/0/en/After-an-Unpredictable-Year-Recruiters-Foresee-Big-Tech-Changes-in-2026-Says-Research-from-Employ-Inc.html)
- [What capabilities do you need that current tools don't provide?](https://www.technology.org/2025/12/19/revolutionizing-hiring-the-power-of-top-ai-recruitment-software/)
- [Are you getting ROI from expensive platforms or could you switch to more affordable alternatives?](https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/tools/best-recruiting-crm/)

[Buyers are increasingly discerning around measurable impact and savvy about investing in new technologies](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/08/3201460/0/en/After-an-Unpredictable-Year-Recruiters-Foresee-Big-Tech-Changes-in-2026-Says-Research-from-Employ-Inc.html). Document which tools delivered value and which didn't so you can make informed upgrade decisions in 2026.

## Set Realistic Q1 Expectations

[Applications for positions jumped 27% compared to last December](https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/10/16/job-seeker-interest-in-holiday-jobs-surges/). January will be chaotic with everyone hiring simultaneously.

**Prepare for Q1 reality:**
- [Candidate response times will be slower because they're getting multiple offers](https://qz.com/job-search-december-new-year-delay-data-history)
- [Interview scheduling will be harder with everyone competing for candidate time](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)
- [Offer acceptance rates might drop as candidates leverage multiple opportunities](https://qz.com/job-search-december-new-year-delay-data-history)

Set expectations with hiring managers now: January hiring is competitive. The candidates you interview will have other offers. Decision speed matters.

## Take Care of Your Team

Your recruiting team worked hard in 2025. Make sure they actually take time off and disconnect.

**Team priorities:**
- Confirm PTO schedules so you know who's available when
- [Distribute urgent responsibilities so nobody's solely responsible during holidays](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)
- Set clear "we're not working on this until January" boundaries
- [Acknowledge effort and results from 2025](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/best-recruitment-analytics-software/)

Burned out recruiters in January won't perform well during the busiest hiring month. Rest now pays dividends later.

## The Bottom Line

You have three days before Christmas. You can't fix everything, close every position, or prepare perfectly for 2026. Prioritize what matters:

1. [Secure budget and extend reqs so you don't lose headcount](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)
2. [Clean ATS data so your reports are accurate](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/best-recruitment-analytics-software/)
3. [Document 2025 metrics before you forget what happened](https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/tools/best-recruitment-analytics-software/)
4. [Start building Q1 pipeline while competition is low](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)
5. [Review tech stack and plan 2026 upgrades](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/08/3201460/0/en/After-an-Unpredictable-Year-Recruiters-Foresee-Big-Tech-Changes-in-2026-Says-Research-from-Employ-Inc.html)

Everything else can wait until January. [Companies that use December strategically will start 2026 ahead](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire). Companies that coast until January will spend Q1 catching up.

Your call.
