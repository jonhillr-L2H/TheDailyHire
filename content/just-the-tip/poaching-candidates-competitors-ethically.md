# How to Poach Candidates from Competitors (Ethically and Legally)

Let's be honest: **the best candidates for your open roles are already working for your competitors**.

They understand your industry, your customers, your technical challenges. They have exactly the skills and experience you need. And according to [LinkedIn's 2025 Talent Trends Report](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/), **73% of employed professionals** are open to hearing about new opportunities even when they're not actively job searching.

So yeah, you should be recruiting from competitors. But there's a right way to do it—and a wrong way that can get you sued, damage your reputation, and burn bridges you might need later.

Here's the playbook.

## What's Legal (And What's Not)

First, let's clear up the legal stuff because this matters.

According to [employment attorneys interviewed by SHRM](https://www.shrm.org/) and [research from Littler Mendelson](https://www.littler.com/), here's what you need to know:

### ✅ Legal and Ethical:

- **Reaching out to competitor employees on LinkedIn** or other public platforms
- **Posting jobs that competitor employees might see** and apply to
- **Recruiting people you know from previous jobs** at competitor companies
- **Offering better compensation, benefits, or opportunities** to attract talent
- **Hiring employees who voluntarily resign** from competitors

### ❌ Illegal or Unethical:

- **Encouraging employees to violate non-compete agreements** (varies by state—California bans most non-competes, other states enforce them)
- **Asking candidates to bring confidential information** from their current employer
- **Systematic "raid hiring"** of entire teams designed to cripple a competitor
- **Collusion with other companies to limit recruiting** (wage-fixing or no-poach agreements)
- **Making false promises** about roles, compensation, or company stability to lure candidates

Bottom line: You can recruit individuals based on merit and opportunity. You can't orchestrate mass defections or encourage theft of trade secrets.

## The "Don't Be a Jerk" Rules

Beyond legal compliance, there are ethical guidelines that separate professional recruiters from shady operators.

[Harvard Business Review's research on recruiting ethics](https://hbr.org/) emphasizes several principles:

**1. Be Transparent**

Don't pretend you're not a recruiter. Don't pretend you're reaching out for "networking" when you're actually recruiting. Be upfront about why you're contacting them.

**Bad approach:** "Hey, I'd love to pick your brain about the industry over coffee!"

**Good approach:** "Hey, I'm recruiting for [Role] at [Company] and your background at [Competitor] caught my attention. Would you be open to a conversation?"

**2. Don't Trash Their Current Employer**

Even if you know their company is a dumpster fire, don't badmouth it. Focus on what's great about YOUR opportunity, not what sucks about theirs.

**Bad approach:** "I heard [Competitor] is doing layoffs and treating employees terribly. You should jump ship!"

**Good approach:** "We're growing our team and think your experience could translate really well to what we're building."

**3. Respect Non-Competes (Where They Exist)**

If a candidate mentions they have a non-compete, don't encourage them to ignore it. [Non-competes are enforceable in many states](https://www.dol.gov/) and violating them can create legal liability for both the candidate and your company.

**What to do:** Consult your legal team if a strong candidate has a non-compete. Sometimes they're narrower than they appear, or there are workarounds (different role, different territory, waiting period).

## How to Find Competitor Employees

The most effective sourcing strategies for competitive recruiting:

### Strategy #1: LinkedIn Boolean Search

Use targeted LinkedIn searches to find people with your competitor's name in their current experience:

**Search string example:**
```
"Software Engineer" AND "currentcompany:[Competitor Name]" AND "Python" AND "5 years"
```

[LinkedIn Recruiter](https://www.linkedin.com/talent/recruiter) makes this easier with filters for current company, years of experience, and skills.

**Pro tip:** Look for people who recently joined the competitor (less than 12 months). According to [Jobvite's research](https://www.jobvite.com/), employees in their first year at a company are **3x more likely** to consider new opportunities than those who've been there 2+ years.

### Strategy #2: Conference and Event Attendees

Your competitors' employees attend the same industry conferences you do. [Research from Bizzabo](https://www.bizzabo.com/) shows that **67% of professionals** are open to job conversations at conferences.

**How to use this:**
- Check conference speaker lists and attendee directories
- Attend talks given by competitor employees
- Network at receptions and after-parties
- Follow up with LinkedIn connections post-conference

### Strategy #3: GitHub and Open Source Contributions

For technical roles, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a goldmine. Search for repositories owned by your competitor or contributions from developers who list your competitor as their employer.

**Why this works:** You can see their actual code quality, communication style, and technical expertise before you even reach out.

### Strategy #4: Employee Referrals from Former Competitor Employees

Your best source? **People who used to work at the competitor and now work for you.**

According to [iCIMS research](https://www.icims.com/), referrals from former competitor employees have:
- **5x higher conversion rates** than cold outreach
- **40% faster time-to-hire** because they already know the culture fit
- **Higher retention** because the referrer vouches for both sides

**How to activate this:** Ask new hires from competitors to recommend top performers from their previous teams after they've been with you for 3-6 months.

## The Outreach Approach That Works

So you've identified someone at a competitor. Now what?

Based on [Gem's recruiting best practices guide](https://www.gem.com/) and [analysis from Lever](https://www.lever.co/), here's what works:

### The Subject Line

Be direct and reference the competitor connection:

**Examples:**
- "Fellow [Competitor] alum here - [Company] [Role]"
- "[Role] at [Company] - relevant to your [Competitor] experience"
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out about [Role]"

### The Message Structure

**Paragraph 1:** Who you are, why you're reaching out
- "I'm recruiting for [Role] at [Company]. I saw your background at [Competitor] and thought this might be relevant."

**Paragraph 2:** Why their specific experience matters
- "Your work on [specific project/technology] aligns perfectly with what we're building. We're focused on [specific challenge] and need someone with deep experience in [their specialty]."

**Paragraph 3:** The value proposition
- "We're offering [specific benefits]: [remote work/equity/leadership opportunity/whatever is most compelling]. Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation to learn more?"

**Keep it under 150 words.** [Research from Yesware](https://www.yesware.com/) shows emails under 125 words get **50% higher response rates** than longer ones.

## The Conversation Strategy

You got a response. They're willing to chat. Now you need to move them from "passively interested" to "actively interviewing."

[According to Greenhouse's candidate engagement research](https://www.greenhouse.io/), the key is addressing the real reasons people leave competitors:

### What Competitor Employees Actually Want:

Based on [LinkedIn's Why People Change Jobs report](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/):

1. **Career growth (48%)** - They feel stuck or see no path to promotion
2. **Compensation (42%)** - They're underpaid relative to market
3. **Better manager/team (35%)** - Their current manager is the reason they're looking
4. **More interesting work (32%)** - They're bored or unchallenged
5. **Mission/values alignment (28%)** - They don't believe in what the company is doing

**Your job:** Figure out which of these motivates your candidate and position your opportunity accordingly.

### The Questions That Uncover Motivation:

- "What's going well in your current role?"
- "If you could change one thing about your current situation, what would it be?"
- "What would make you excited enough to consider leaving [Competitor]?"
- "What does your ideal next career move look like?"

Don't pitch until you understand what they care about. Then tailor your pitch to those specific motivations.

## The Offer Strategy

You've made it through interviews. Now you need to get them to actually accept your offer over their current role.

### The Counteroffer Problem

[Research from Robert Half](https://www.roberthalf.com/) shows that **57% of candidates** who resign receive counteroffers from their current employer. And **38% of those** accept the counteroffer and stay.

You need to get ahead of this.

**During the interview process:**

Ask: "If you were to resign from [Competitor], do you think they'd make a counteroffer? How would you think about that?"

This plants the seed that counteroffers are expected and forces them to think through their decision before it happens.

**When extending your offer:**

Be generous and move fast. Don't lowball. Don't drag out negotiations.

According to [Lever's offer acceptance research](https://www.lever.co/), offers extended within 48 hours of final interviews have **23% higher acceptance rates** than those that take a week.

**After they accept:**

Stay in touch during the notice period. Send them articles about the company, introduce them to future teammates, get them excited about starting.

[Greenhouse research](https://www.greenhouse.io/) shows that **18% of accepted offers fall through** during the notice period, often because of counteroffers or cold feet. Don't let them get lonely.

## The Ethical Line You Can't Cross

Here's where recruiters sometimes get sleazy: **encouraging candidates to bring proprietary information from their competitor**.

Never do this. Ever.

Don't ask them to:
- Share customer lists
- Bring product roadmaps or strategy documents
- Forward internal emails or Slack conversations
- Provide competitive intelligence beyond what's public knowledge

According to [the Economic Espionage Act](https://www.justice.gov/) and various state laws, soliciting trade secrets can result in criminal charges. And even if it's not criminal, it's unethical and will destroy your reputation.

**What you CAN do:** Hire people for the skills and knowledge in their heads. What you CAN'T do: Ask them to steal documents or data.

## The Bottom Line

Recruiting from competitors is fair game. It's how talent markets work. The best people move between companies, bringing skills and fresh perspectives.

But do it right:
- Be transparent about your intentions
- Respect legal boundaries (non-competes, trade secrets)
- Focus on what you're offering, not what their current employer lacks
- Move fast and be generous when you find the right person

And remember: today's competitor employee is tomorrow's colleague. Treat them with the respect and professionalism you'd want if the situation were reversed.

Happy (ethical) poaching.
