After 30 years in recruiting, I've seen people ignore every red flag imaginable and then act shocked when the job turns out terrible. [Your gut is usually right](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/trusting-instinct-job-search). Here are the warnings you absolutely should not ignore.

## Interview Process Red Flags

**They can't describe the role clearly.**
[If the hiring manager can't explain what you'll actually be doing, they don't know](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/unclear-role-definition-warning). [You'll be figuring it out as you go, with no support](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/role-clarity-importance).

**Multiple rounds of interviews with no clear timeline.**
[One company had a candidate do NINE interviews over four months](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/excessive-interview-rounds). [If they can't make a decision, they can't make any decisions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/decision-making-culture-indicator). [Imagine working there](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/indecisive-employer-red-flag).

**Everyone you meet looks exhausted or stressed.**
[Pay attention to people's energy and body language](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/observing-employee-demeanor). [If the team looks like they're barely holding it together, believe what you're seeing](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/employee-appearance-culture-indicator).

**High turnover in the role you're interviewing for.**
["The last three people left after less than a year."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/high-turnover-position-warning) [The problem is the job, not the people](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/role-specific-turnover-red-flag). Don't think you'll be different.

## Communication Red Flags

**They ghost you between interview stages.**
[If they can't respond to candidates professionally during the interview process—when they're supposedly trying to impress you—imagine how they'll treat you as an employee](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-ghosting-employer-red-flag).

**They pressure you to decide immediately.**
["We need an answer by tomorrow or the offer expires."](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/high-pressure-offer-tactics) [Legitimate companies give you reasonable time to decide](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reasonable-offer-response-time). [This is a manipulation tactic](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/pressure-tactics-red-flags).

**They're vague about salary until the very end.**
["Let's see if you're a good fit first."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/salary-transparency-importance) Translation: [We're hoping to lowball you once you're emotionally invested](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/delayed-salary-discussion-tactic).

**HR or hiring manager is defensive when you ask questions.**
[Good companies welcome tough questions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-questions-welcomed). [Bad companies get uncomfortable when you ask about anything real](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/defensive-responses-interview).

## Culture and Values Red Flags

**"We're like a family."**
[No, you're a business](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/we-are-family-workplace-red-flag). [This phrase usually means boundary violations, guilt-tripping, and expecting you to sacrifice for "the family"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/family-culture-warning-signs).

**"We work hard and play hard."**
[Translation: expect long hours and mandatory "fun" activities you can't opt out of](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/work-hard-play-hard-culture-problems).

**All the perks are on-site (gym, meals, dry cleaning, etc.).**
[They're not being nice—they're trying to keep you there as long as possible](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/on-site-perks-intention). [They're literally removing reasons to leave the office](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/on-site-amenities-work-life-balance).

**They emphasize "passion" and "dedication" repeatedly.**
[Code for: we pay below market but expect you to work like it's your calling](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/passion-exploitation-warning). [Passion doesn't pay rent](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/passion-vs-compensation).

## Job Description Red Flags

**The requirements are completely unrealistic.**
["5+ years experience with technology that's been around for 2 years."](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/impossible-requirements-job-postings) [They don't know what they actually need](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/unrealistic-job-requirements-meaning).

**"Wear many hats" or "generalist."**
[Translation: You'll do the work of 3-4 people for one salary](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/wear-many-hats-red-flag). [They're understaffed and won't fix it](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/understaffing-signals).

**Salary range is insulting given the responsibilities.**
["$45K for a Senior Marketing Manager role requiring 7+ years experience."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/lowball-salary-ranges) [If they're that out of touch with market rates, run](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/below-market-compensation-red-flag).

**Vague about what success looks like.**
["Contribute to team goals" and "support company growth" tell you nothing](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/vague-success-metrics). [How will you know if you're doing well? You won't](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/unclear-expectations-problem).

## Glassdoor and Online Presence Red Flags

**Every negative review gets a defensive, corporate response.**
[Or worse, no response at all](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/glassdoor-response-quality). [Companies that can't handle criticism gracefully are toxic workplaces](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/employer-brand/defensive-review-responses).

**Sudden spike in 5-star reviews after bad publicity.**
[Someone's gaming the system](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/fake-review-patterns). [Read the 3-star reviews—those are usually most honest](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/employer-brand/middle-rating-reviews-valuable).

**Company social media is all self-promotion, zero authenticity.**
[If they can't show real people doing real work, what are they hiding?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/authentic-employer-branding)

**LinkedIn shows a revolving door of people in the same roles.**
[Check tenure on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/linkedin-tenure-research). [If everyone leaves after 8-12 months, there's a reason](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/short-tenure-patterns-investigation).

## Offer and Onboarding Red Flags

**The offer letter is vague or missing key details.**
[No start date, unclear compensation breakdown, missing benefits information](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employment-law-compliance/offer-letter-completeness)? [That's sloppy at best, shady at worst](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/incomplete-offer-letter-concerns).

**They want you to start immediately (like, tomorrow).**
[Why the urgency? Usually because the last person quit without notice or got fired](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/immediate-start-date-red-flag). [You're walking into a crisis](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/emergency-hire-concerns).

**No structured onboarding plan.**
["You'll shadow someone for a day then just figure it out."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/lack-onboarding-structure) [Companies that don't invest in onboarding don't invest in employee success](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/onboarding-investment-indicator).

## What to Do When You See Red Flags

**One red flag?** [Ask about it directly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/addressing-concerns-interview). [Sometimes there's a reasonable explanation](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/red-flag-clarification).

**Multiple red flags?** [Trust your gut and walk away](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/trusting-instincts-job-offers). [A bad job will damage your mental health, your resume, and your confidence](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/toxic-job-costs).

**Red flags but you need the money?** [Take the job but keep looking](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/survival-job-strategy). [Don't stop your job search just because you accepted an offer](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/continuing-search-after-accepting). [This is survival, not a long-term plan](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/short-term-job-mindset).

## The Bottom Line

[The interview process tells you EVERYTHING about how the company actually operates](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-process-culture-reflection). [Disorganized interviews = disorganized company. Disrespectful communication = disrespectful workplace](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/interview-experience-workplace-preview).

[When people show you who they are, believe them the first time](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/heeding-warning-signs). [Don't convince yourself you can fix it or that you're being too picky](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/ignoring-red-flags-consequences). [You can't, and you're not](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/career-development/standards-not-pickiness).

[Life is too short to waste months in a job that was waving red flags from the start](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/red-flag-cost-calculation). [Pay attention and save yourself the headache](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-search-vigilance).
