The conventional wisdom is that nobody hires during the holidays. Candidates aren't looking. Hiring managers are unavailable. Everything pauses until January.

[That's mostly wrong](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire). [The volume of applicants drops by 20-25% in December, but hiring doesn't stop](https://www.greatbaystaffing.com/job-blog/2025/12/16/why-december-might-be-the-secret-weapon-month-for-job-seekers-while-everyone-else-is-hibernating). For recruiters willing to work while competitors coast, December is one of the most efficient hiring months of the year.

Here's how to make holiday recruiting actually work.

## Use the Competition Advantage

[Less competition exists because most companies pause hiring during the holidays](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire). [That means the candidates you want aren't getting dozens of other offers](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire).

**How to capitalize:**
- [Post your openings now while job board traffic is lower—your listings get more visibility per view](https://medium.com/@Elijah.A/land-your-dream-job-during-the-holidays-why-december-is-peak-hiring-season-bd1043039e2c)
- [Reach out to passive candidates when their inboxes aren't flooded with recruiting messages](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/)
- [Move faster than competitors who are waiting until January to engage candidates](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)

[For candidates actively applying during December, they're motivated and ready to make a move](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/). [They're not waiting for New Year's resolutions—they want to start now](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/).

Your offer stands out when competitors aren't making offers. January? Everyone's competing for the same candidates simultaneously.

## Solve the Scheduling Challenge

The legitimate problem with December hiring is coordinating schedules when people are out of office. But it's solvable.

**Scheduling strategies:**
- [Use asynchronous video interviews so candidates can record responses during the holidays](https://hirevire.com/blog/best-asynchronous-video-interview-platforms)
- [Schedule final-round interviews for early January but conduct initial screenings in December](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)
- [Have backup interviewers identified for when primary interviewers are unavailable](https://goodtime.io/blog/talent-operations/best-interview-scheduling-software/)
- [Offer flexible interview times including evenings and weekends for candidates using PTO](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/)

[Interview scheduling automation tools can help identify available time slots and balance workloads](https://www.modernloop.com/scheduling/), making coordination easier even when people are traveling or taking time off.

## Target the Right Candidates

Not all candidates are unavailable during holidays. Some are strategically job hunting right now.

**Who's actively looking in December:**
- [Employed candidates with year-end bonuses that vest on December 31st](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/)
- People burning use-it-or-lose-it PTO and using that time to interview
- [Candidates who just finished major projects and can transition cleanly](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/)
- Workers in industries with holiday slowdowns (retail, education, hospitality)
- Recent graduates who finished degrees in December and want immediate employment

[People applying for jobs in December aren't just browsing—they're motivated and ready to make a move](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/). Quality can actually be higher because serious candidates self-select into December job searches.

## Leverage Budget Realities

[Many companies have approved positions and budget that expires at year-end](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/). [Companies often have use-it-or-lose-it headcount to fill](https://medium.com/@Elijah.A/land-your-dream-job-during-the-holidays-why-december-is-peak-hiring-season-bd1043039e2c).

**Use budget urgency:**
- [Prioritize roles with year-end budget that won't carry into Q1](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)
- [Close positions quickly while budget is still allocated](https://medium.com/@Elijah.A/land-your-dream-job-during-the-holidays-why-december-is-peak-hiring-season-bd1043039e2c)
- [Make competitive offers knowing budget expires soon](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)

Finance doesn't want to start 2026 explaining why approved headcount wasn't filled. That urgency can accelerate decision-making and approval processes that normally drag.

## Adjust Your Outreach Strategy

December recruiting requires different messaging than normal outreach.

**Holiday-appropriate outreach:**
- Acknowledge the timing: "I know it's the holidays, but wanted to reach out about an opportunity that might interest you in the new year."
- [Be respectful of time: "No rush to respond—happy to connect in January if that works better."](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/)
- [Emphasize flexibility: "We can schedule initial conversations whenever works for you, including early January."](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)
- [Highlight benefits of starting in January: "This role would start in mid-January, giving you time to wrap up current responsibilities."](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)

Don't pretend it's not the holidays. Acknowledge reality and work within it.

## Focus on Pipeline Building, Not Immediate Closes

December doesn't have to be about closing positions this month. [It's about building pipeline for January when hiring accelerates](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire).

**Pipeline building tactics:**
- [Source candidates now while competition is low](https://www.estrinreport.com/why-the-holiday-season-is-the-best-time-to-job-hunt-yes-really/)
- [Conduct phone screens and initial interviews in December](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)
- [Schedule final rounds and offers for early January](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)
- [Build relationships with passive candidates for future opportunities](https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/tools/best-recruiting-crm/)

[Companies that build strong teams now will be ready when business picks up in Q1](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/) rather than scrambling to staff up while simultaneously trying to hit revenue targets.

## Work With Realistic Expectations

Not every role is suitable for December hiring. Know which positions to prioritize.

**Good for December hiring:**
- [Entry-level and mid-level positions with straightforward interview processes](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)
- Roles with January or February start dates
- [High-volume hiring where competition matters more than timing](https://hirevire.com/blog/best-asynchronous-video-interview-platforms)
- Positions where hiring managers are available despite holidays

**Wait until January:**
- Executive and senior leadership roles requiring extensive stakeholder involvement
- [Positions needing complex, multi-day interview processes](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)
- Roles where hiring managers and key interviewers are completely unavailable

Match your recruiting strategy to what's realistic given holiday constraints.

## Communicate Proactively

Candidates and hiring managers need clear communication about what happens during holidays.

**Set clear expectations:**
- Tell candidates upfront: "We're conducting initial interviews through December, with final rounds scheduled for early January."
- [Confirm with hiring managers which dates they're available and which they're not](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)
- [Update candidates on timeline changes: "Our team will be out December 24-26, so next steps will happen the week of December 29th."](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)
- [Provide backup contacts for urgent questions when you're out of office](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)

Radio silence during holidays frustrates candidates. Proactive communication maintains engagement even when response times slow.

## Use Technology to Your Advantage

[Interview scheduling automation and asynchronous video interviews enable recruiting when schedules don't align](https://www.modernloop.com/scheduling/).

**Tech that helps:**
- [Automated scheduling tools that handle coordination without manual back-and-forth](https://www.paradox.ai/products/conversational-scheduling)
- [Asynchronous video interviews that candidates complete on their schedule](https://hirevire.com/blog/best-asynchronous-video-interview-platforms)
- [Chatbots that answer candidate questions 24/7 even when recruiters are offline](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/ai-changing-recruitment)
- [CRM tools that automate follow-up sequences to keep candidates engaged](https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/tools/best-recruiting-crm/)

Technology can't replace human judgment, but it can handle logistics that would otherwise require constant availability.

## The January Comparison

Compare December to January reality:

**December recruiting:**
- [20-25% lower application volume but serious, motivated candidates](https://www.greatbaystaffing.com/job-blog/2025/12/16/why-december-might-be-the-secret-weapon-month-for-job-seekers-while-everyone-else-is-hibernating)
- [Minimal competition from other employers](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire)
- Scheduling challenges but flexible candidates
- [Use-it-or-lose-it budget creating urgency](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)

**January recruiting:**
- [27% higher application volume but scattered across hundreds of employers](https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/10/16/job-seeker-interest-in-holiday-jobs-surges/)
- [Every company hiring simultaneously, creating intense competition](https://qz.com/job-search-december-new-year-delay-data-history)
- Easier scheduling but candidates juggling multiple interview processes
- [Candidates leveraging multiple offers, slower decision-making](https://qz.com/job-search-december-new-year-delay-data-history)

December is harder logistically but often faster to close. January has more candidates but more competition.

## The Bottom Line

[Hiring doesn't stop in December—it slows down](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire). [For recruiters willing to work through holidays while competitors pause, it's one of the most efficient months of the year](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire).

[Less competition, motivated candidates, and budget urgency make December viable for strategic hiring](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/). [The coordination challenges are real but solvable with flexible scheduling and technology](https://www.modernloop.com/scheduling/).

[Companies that recruit effectively in December will start 2026 ahead](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire). Companies that wait until January will spend Q1 competing with every other employer chasing the same candidates.

Your choice: [recruit strategically now while it's quiet, or fight for talent in January when everyone's hiring](https://www.sedonastaffing.com/holiday-slowdowns-hidden-opportunities-why-december-is-the-best-time-to-hire).
