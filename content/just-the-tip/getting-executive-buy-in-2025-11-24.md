You need a new ATS. Or another recruiter. Or that fancy sourcing tool that costs more than your monthly rent.

You know it'll help. Your boss knows it'll help. But the executives holding the purse strings? They need to be seduced with something sexier than "it'll make recruiting easier."

They need ROI language.

## Translate Recruiting Metrics Into Business Impact

Executives don't care about time-to-fill. They care about revenue, costs, and competitive advantage.

**Don't say:** "This tool will reduce our time-to-fill by 10 days."

**Say:** "This tool will reduce time-to-fill by 10 days, which at our current hiring volume means 15 additional productive employee-days per month. At an average revenue-per-employee of $X, that's $Y in recovered productivity."

See the difference? Same tool. Different language. One gets funded.

## The Executive Buy-In Framework

**Step 1: Quantify the current pain**

"We're spending 47 hours per week on manual sourcing. At our average recruiter cost, that's $X per month in labor on tasks that could be automated."

**Step 2: Show the investment**

"The tool costs $Y per month."

**Step 3: Calculate the ROI**

"Net savings of $Z per month, or [X]% ROI in the first year. Payback period: 3 months."

## The Magic Ratio

Executives love ratios. Give them one.

"For every $1 we spend on this tool, we'll save $4 in recruiter time and reduce cost-per-hire by 23%."

Suddenly you're not asking for money—you're offering them a deal they'd be foolish to refuse.

## Headcount Requests: The Script

"We're currently at a 45:1 requisition-to-recruiter ratio. Industry benchmark is 25:1. This means we're leaving roles open 3 weeks longer than competitors. At our average revenue-per-employee, that's $X in delayed productivity per month. An additional recruiter at $Y salary would generate $Z in value."

## The Bottom Line

Executives aren't saying no to your requests—they're saying no to requests they don't understand.

Speak their language. Show the math. Make it about business outcomes, not recruiting convenience.

When you pitch in ROI, you're not begging for budget—you're offering them a business case they can defend to their board.

Now that's the kind of proposition that gets a "yes."
