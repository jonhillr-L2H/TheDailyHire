[The follow-up email is where most candidates either blow it or ghost themselves](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-follow-up-best-practices). Too eager and you look desperate. Too laid-back and they think you're not interested. Here's exactly when to send what.

## The Thank-You Email: 24 Hours Max

**When:** [Within 24 hours of the interview](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/thank-you-email-timing-statistics). Ideally same day.

**Why:** [Shows you're organized, professional, and actually interested](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/thank-you-note-importance). [80% of hiring managers say thank-you notes influence their decision](https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/thank-you-note-statistics), but [only 24% of candidates send them](https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/job-interview-tips/does-anyone-send-thank-you-notes-anymore). Easy win.

**What to include:**
- Thanks for their time
- [One specific thing from the conversation that resonated](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/personalized-thank-you-email)
- Brief reiteration of why you're excited about the role
- [Any follow-up you promised (portfolio link, references, etc.)](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/thank-you-email-action-items)

**Keep it short.** [Three paragraphs max](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/thank-you-email-length). They're busy.

## The Check-In Email: Timing Depends on What They Told You

**If they said "We'll get back to you by Friday":**
Wait until Monday. [Give them the timeline they requested plus one business day](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/following-up-after-deadline).

**If they said "We'll be in touch soon" (no specific timeline):**
[Wait 7-10 business days](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/follow-up-email-no-timeline-given), then send a polite check-in.

**If they said "We're interviewing through next week, then deciding":**
[Wait until the week after their stated decision period, then follow up](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/respecting-hiring-timeline).

**What to say:**
"Hi [Name], I wanted to follow up on my interview for the [Role] position on [Date]. I'm still very interested in the opportunity and would love to know where things stand. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me. Thanks!"

[Short, professional, doesn't sound annoying](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/follow-up-email-template-professional).

## The Second Follow-Up: One More Try, Then Move On

**When:** [Another week after your first follow-up if you heard nothing](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/second-follow-up-timing).

**What to say:**
"Hi [Name], I know hiring timelines can shift, so I wanted to reach out one more time about the [Role] position. I'm still very interested, but I also want to be respectful of your time. If you're able to share any updates on timing or next steps, I'd really appreciate it. If not, I totally understand. Thanks again for considering me."

[This gives them an out while showing you're still interested](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/graceful-follow-up-closing).

**After this?** [Stop following up](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/when-to-stop-following-up). Move on. If they wanted you, they'd respond. [Getting ghosted sucks, but harassing them won't change their mind](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-ghosting-by-employers-response).

## Special Situations

**You have another offer with a deadline:**
Email or call immediately. Don't wait for their timeline.

"Hi [Name], I wanted to let you know that I've received another offer with a decision deadline of [Date]. [Your Company] is still my top choice, and I'm hoping to understand where I stand in your process. Is there any way to expedite a decision, or can you give me a sense of timeline? I appreciate any guidance you can provide."

[This is completely reasonable and often speeds things up](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/competing-offer-timeline-communication). [Good companies won't penalize you for having options](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/competing-offers-transparency).

**You forgot to mention something important in the interview:**
[Send a quick note within 24-48 hours](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/adding-information-after-interview).

"Hi [Name], thank you again for taking the time to interview me yesterday. I realized after we spoke that I didn't mention [relevant accomplishment/experience]. I wanted to make sure you had the full picture: [brief explanation]. Looking forward to hearing from you!"

[This shows thoughtfulness, not desperation](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/follow-up-with-additional-info).

## What NOT to Do

**Don't follow up every other day.** [You're not refreshing their memory, you're annoying them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/excessive-follow-up-backfires).

**Don't write a novel.** [Nobody's reading your 600-word follow-up email](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/follow-up-email-too-long). Keep it brief.

**Don't neg them.** ["I'm sure you're busy, but..." or "I know you probably forgot about me..." makes it weird](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/passive-aggressive-follow-up). Stay professional.

**Don't follow up on nights or weekends.** [Send emails during business hours](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/follow-up-email-send-timing). Monday-Thursday, 9-5. Schedule send if you have to.

**Don't connect on LinkedIn before they respond.** [Especially with the generic "I'd like to add you to my professional network" message](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/linkedin-connection-request-timing). Weird energy.

## The Harsh Truth

[If you've followed up twice and gotten zero response, they're not hiring you](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-ghosting-reality). [They're either going with someone else, the role got put on hold, or they're disorganized](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reasons-for-no-response). Either way, continuing to follow up won't help.

[It's not about you—hiring processes are messy and companies are bad at communication](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/employer-communication-candidates-statistics). [Move on to opportunities with companies that actually respond like professionals](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/respectful-candidate-communication).

## The Bottom Line

[Following up shows interest without being pushy if you time it right](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/effective-follow-up-strategy). 24 hours for thank you, 7-10 days for check-in, one more week if you hear nothing, then done.

[Set reminders on your calendar so you don't have to remember](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/follow-up-calendar-system). [Track your applications and follow-ups in a spreadsheet](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-search-tracking-system). Make it systematic, not emotional.

And remember: [if a company can't be bothered to respond to your professional, appropriately-timed follow-ups, that tells you something about how they treat people](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/candidate-experience-reflects-culture). Sometimes the trash takes itself out.
