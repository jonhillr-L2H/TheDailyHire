Real talk: Your job descriptions are probably why you're getting crickets from top talent. Let's fix that. Because the way you're writing job posts right now? It's actively repelling the exact candidates you want to attract.

The job market has evolved, but many job descriptions haven't kept pace. Candidates today are savvy, selective, and have options. They're not desperately scrolling through boring corporate copy hoping to find something that doesn't make them want to take a nap. If your job description doesn't grab attention in the first three seconds, they've already moved on to the next opportunity.

## Lead With Why It Matters

Nobody cares about "synergizing cross-functional deliverables." Seriously, what does that even mean? Tell them the actual impact they'll have. What problems will they solve? Why should they care? What difference will they make?

Start with the meaningful stuff: "You'll build the platform that helps 10,000 small businesses manage their finances" hits way different than "seeking motivated self-starter to leverage innovative solutions." One tells a story, the other makes people's eyes glaze over.

Paint a picture of what success looks like in this role. Will they be launching products that millions of people use? Mentoring a team? Solving technical challenges that haven't been cracked yet? Lead with the exciting parts, not the boring organizational structure.

## Stop Asking For Unicorns

That list of 47 required skills? Delete it. Pick the 5 things that actually matter. Everyone knows "5+ years required" means "we'll consider 3" anyway, so stop fronting. You're not fooling anyone, and you're scaring away perfectly qualified candidates who don't check every single box.

Here's a secret: Your ideal candidate probably doesn't exist. And if they did, they wouldn't need this job. Focus on must-haves vs. nice-to-haves, and be honest about what's actually essential on day one versus what someone can learn on the job.

The "must be proficient in 15 different programming languages" requirement? That's how you filter out everyone except the people who lie on their resumes. Pick the 3-5 skills that truly matter and let talented people show you they can figure out the rest.

## Show Some Personality

If your company is fun, your job description should reflect that. If you're serious and professional, own that too. Just be authentic instead of corporate-speak central. Your job description is often a candidate's first interaction with your company culture—make it count.

Stop trying to sound like every other company. "Fast-paced environment" and "wearing many hats" are so overused they've lost all meaning. Instead, tell candidates what it's actually like to work there. Do you have flexible hours? Remote Fridays? A team that loves bad puns? Say that.

Companies with personality in their job descriptions get more applications from candidates who are actually a good fit. Because people can sense authenticity, and they're drawn to workplaces where they can be themselves.

## Put The Money In The Post

Salary ranges aren't optional anymore. If you're playing hide-and-seek with compensation info, candidates are swiping left before they even read the rest. Salary transparency is becoming legally required in more places, and even where it's not, it's expected.

Not posting salary ranges signals one of two things: either you're paying below market rate, or you're hoping to lowball candidates who don't know better. Neither is a good look. Be upfront about compensation and you'll save everyone time—including yours.

The "competitive salary based on experience" line fools nobody. Just give a range. It doesn't have to be exact, but "80K-110K depending on experience" is infinitely more helpful than making candidates guess.

## Paint The Career Path

Top performers want to know where this role can take them. "Room for growth" is vague and meaningless. "Could lead to Director role within 2 years" hits different and shows you're serious about development.

Talk about what professional development looks like at your company. Do you pay for conferences? Offer mentorship programs? Have a track record of promoting from within? Say that. Ambitious candidates want to know this isn't a dead-end role.

Your job description is your first impression. Make it slap, not cringe. Write like a human, be honest about what you're offering, and show candidates why they should be excited about this opportunity. Because the companies who are winning the talent war? They figured this out years ago.
