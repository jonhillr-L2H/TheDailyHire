[Most people treat references like an afterthought—names to throw on a list at the last minute](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-preparation-importance). Then they're shocked when a reference gives a lukewarm endorsement or, worse, reveals something that kills the offer.

Don't be that person. Here's how to actually prepare your references so they help you land the job.

## Step 1: Choose the Right People

**Don't just list whoever will say yes.** [Strategic selection matters](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/choosing-job-references-strategically).

**Best options:**
- [Direct managers from recent roles (last 3-5 years)](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/best-job-references-managers)
- [Senior colleagues who've seen your work closely](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/peer-references-value)
- [Clients or stakeholders who can speak to your results](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/external-stakeholder-references)

**Avoid:**
- [People you haven't spoken to in 5+ years](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/outdated-references-problem)
- [Friends or family (seriously, don't)](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/personal-references-inappropriate)
- [Anyone who you left on bad terms with, obviously](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/negative-reference-risks)
- [Your current boss if you're employed and they don't know you're looking](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/current-employer-reference-timing)

## Step 2: Ask Permission (The Right Way)

[Don't just slap someone's name on your reference list and hope for the best](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/asking-permission-references). Actually ask them.

**The message:**
"Hi [Name], I'm in the final stages of interviewing for a [Role] at [Company] and they've asked for references. [Would you be willing to serve as a reference for me?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/requesting-reference-script) I'd really value your perspective on [specific things you worked on together]."

[Wait for them to say yes before listing them](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/confirmed-reference-permission). [A reluctant reference is worse than no reference](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/enthusiastic-references-only).

## Step 3: Prep Them (This Is the Part Nobody Does)

[Once they've agreed, send them a quick prep email](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-preparation-email-template). This is where you actually help them help you.

**Include:**
- [The role you're interviewing for and why you're excited about it](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/giving-references-context)
- [2-3 specific projects or accomplishments you worked on together that are relevant to the new role](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-talking-points)
- [Any particular skills or qualities the company is emphasizing](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/aligning-reference-with-role-requirements)
- [When they can expect to be contacted](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-timeline-heads-up)

**Example:**
"Thanks so much for agreeing to be a reference! The role is Senior Marketing Manager at [Company], focusing on content strategy and team leadership.

[A few things that might be helpful if they ask: our work together on the product launch campaign that drove 40% increase in leads, my approach to managing the junior team members, and how I handled the rebrand project under tight deadlines](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-specific-examples).

[They mentioned they're particularly interested in my ability to manage cross-functional projects and mentor team members, so if any examples come to mind around that, it would be great to share](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/highlighting-key-competencies-references).

[They'll probably reach out early next week. Thanks again—I really appreciate it!](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-timing-communication)"

## Step 4: Give Them a Heads Up When It's Happening

[Once you know references are being checked, send a quick note](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-imminent-notification):

"Hi [Name], just a heads up that [Company] will be reaching out to you in the next day or two for a reference check. Thanks again for doing this—means a lot!"

[This ensures they're not caught off guard and can respond promptly](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-response-readiness).

## What Your References Might Be Asked

[Help them prepare by letting them know common questions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/common-reference-check-questions):

- How do you know the candidate and in what capacity?
- [What were their main responsibilities and accomplishments?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-questions-accomplishments)
- [What are their greatest strengths?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-strengths-discussion)
- [Areas where they could improve or develop further?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-growth-areas-discussion)
- [How did they handle challenges or difficult situations?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-problem-solving-examples)
- [Would you hire them again?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/would-rehire-question)

[The "would you rehire them" question is huge](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/rehire-question-importance). [If your reference hesitates even slightly, that's a red flag for the employer](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-hesitation-red-flags).

## The "Areas for Improvement" Trap

[Every reference will be asked about your weaknesses or areas for development](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-weakness-question). [Help them give an answer that's honest but not damaging](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/constructive-weakness-framing).

**Good examples:**
- "Early in our time working together, [they were still developing their delegation skills, but they improved significantly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/growth-trajectory-references)"
- "[Sometimes they're so detail-oriented that projects take longer than necessary, but the quality is always excellent](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/strength-as-weakness-framing)"
- "[They care so much about getting things right that they can be hard on themselves when things don't go perfectly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/perfectionism-reference-framing)"

[These show self-awareness and growth, not fundamental flaws](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-weakness-strategic-framing).

## What NOT to Do

**Don't use someone who doesn't remember you well.** ["I think I worked with them?" is not the vibe you want](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/weak-reference-knowledge).

**Don't overload them with a novel.** [Your prep email should be 3-4 short paragraphs max](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-prep-email-length).

**Don't coach them to lie.** [If you have to tell them what to say, they're the wrong reference](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/authentic-references-only). [Good references speak authentically about your actual work](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/genuine-reference-value).

**Don't ghost them afterward.** [Whether you get the job or not, send a thank-you note to everyone who served as a reference](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/thanking-references-professional-courtesy). [Basic professional courtesy goes a long way](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/reference-thank-you-importance).

## If You Don't Have Great References

[If you're worried you don't have strong references, get creative](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/building-reference-list-challenges):

- [Use skip-level managers (your boss's boss) if your direct manager wasn't great](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/skip-level-references)
- [Include cross-functional partners who worked closely with you](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cross-functional-references)
- [Ask if they'll accept LinkedIn recommendations instead of phone calls](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/linkedin-recommendations-as-references)
- [Be honest in the interview: "I'm happy to provide references, though I'm not able to use my current manager since they don't know I'm looking"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/explaining-reference-limitations)

[Most employers understand that reference situations can be complicated](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/flexible-reference-arrangements).

## The Bottom Line

[Your references can make or break your offer](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-offer-impact-statistics). [Don't leave it to chance](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/proactive-reference-management).

[Choose people who actually know your work, get their permission, prep them with relevant details, and give them a heads up when it's happening](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-best-practices-summary).

[A well-prepared reference can seal the deal. An unprepared one can blow it up](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/reference-preparation-critical). [Take the 20 minutes to do this right](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-prep-time-investment-worth-it).

[Your future employed self will thank you](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/career-advice/reference-preparation-payoff).
