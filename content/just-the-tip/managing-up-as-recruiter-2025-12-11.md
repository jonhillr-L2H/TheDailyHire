Let's be real: your success as a recruiter depends less on your sourcing skills and more on whether you can get hiring managers to respond to candidates, convince leadership to approve competitive offers, and persuade executives that hiring takes time. Managing up isn't optional—it's the core job skill nobody teaches you.

Here's how to train your leadership to work with recruiting effectively, without making them feel like they're being managed by someone below them on the org chart.

## Start with Education, Not Complaints

[When things go wrong in recruiting, the instinct is to complain: "Hiring managers don't respond," "Leadership won't approve market-rate salaries," "Nobody understands how hard recruiting is"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-frustrations-leadership-communication). [That venting might feel good, but it doesn't change anything](https://hbr.com/2020/02/stop-complaining-and-start-leading).

[Instead, educate proactively](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/talent-acquisition/recruiting-stakeholder-education-strategies). [Frame recruiting challenges as opportunities to teach leadership what they don't know](https://www.ere.net/managing-up-recruiters-educational-approach). [Most executives aren't ignoring recruiting realities—they genuinely don't understand them](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/executive-recruiting-knowledge-gaps).

Example: Instead of "We lost another candidate because our offer was too low," try "I'd like to share market data showing how our compensation compares to competitors for this role. [According to Pave's 2025 compensation data](https://www.pave.com/compensation-data), we're offering 15% below market for senior engineers, which is why we're losing finalists. Here's what it would take to be competitive, and the ROI of making that investment."

[You just educated leadership about market realities while positioning yourself as the expert who has solutions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2024/07/how-to-educate-your-boss-without-seeming-condescending/). [That's managing up](https://hbr.com/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up).

## Use Data to Make Your Case

[Leadership responds to numbers, not feelings](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-leadership-persuasion-data-driven-approach). [When you want something—more budget, faster decisions, competitive offers—come with data that supports your case](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-business-case-development).

Want faster hiring manager decisions? [Show them: "When we get interview feedback within 24 hours, candidates accept offers 70% of the time. When feedback takes 5+ days, acceptance rate drops to 40%. [According to Greenhouse data](https://www.greenhouse.com/blog/reducing-time-to-hire-feedback-speed), speed directly impacts our ability to close candidates. What can we do to improve response time?"](https://www.lever.co/blog/interview-feedback-timing-offer-acceptance-correlation)

Want better compensation approval? [Present: "We've made 15 offers this quarter. 8 were accepted, 7 were declined due to compensation. The declined offers averaged 12% below accepted offers. [Research from Pave shows](https://www.pave.com/resources/compensation-offer-acceptance-rates-2025) that offers within 5% of market median have 80%+ acceptance rates. Here's what we need to approve to hit our hiring targets."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/compensation-data-hiring-success-correlation)

[Data makes your requests objective rather than subjective](https://hbr.org/2019/03/how-to-use-data-to-make-a-case-for-anything). [It's harder to ignore numbers than opinions](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/data-driven-decision-making-organizational-effectiveness).

## Frame Everything as Business Impact

[Leadership cares about business outcomes, not recruiting activities](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-business-impact-communication-leadership). [Translate everything you do into language they care about: revenue impact, competitive advantage, risk mitigation](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-roi-communication-executives).

[Don't say: "We need to implement an employee referral program."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-business-case-communication-failures)

[Say: "Employee referrals have 40% lower cost-per-hire and 50% better retention than other sources. [According to Jobvite data](https://www.jobvite.com/recruiting-resources/employee-referral-program-roi/), a strong referral program could save us $150K annually in recruiting fees while improving quality of hire. Here's a proposal to launch one with clear ROI tracking."](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/employee-referral-program-business-case)

[Don't say: "Hiring managers take too long to interview candidates."](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-complaints-ineffective-communication)

[Say: "Our current time-to-interview is 12 days, and [LinkedIn data shows](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/talent-acquisition/time-to-interview-candidate-loss-rates) that 60% of candidates drop out of processes with 10+ day gaps between application and interview. If we reduce time-to-interview to 5 days, we'd increase our candidate conversion by an estimated 25%, meaning fewer roles sitting open and less impact on team productivity."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/time-to-hire-business-impact-analysis)

[Frame recruiting as business outcomes, not recruiting problems](https://hbr.com/2021/03/how-to-talk-about-your-work-in-terms-of-business-impact). [Leadership will listen](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/executive-communication-business-outcomes).

## Build Allies, Not Silos

[Managing up isn't just about managing your direct leadership—it's about building relationships across the organization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2023/09/building-cross-functional-relationships-career-success/). [The hiring managers who love working with you will advocate for you](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/hiring-manager-relationships-recruiting-success). [The executives you've helped will back your initiatives](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-executive-sponsorship-building-support).

[Invest time in understanding what your stakeholders care about](https://hbr.com/2019/07/to-build-better-relationships-start-with-curiosity). [Sales leaders care about hitting revenue targets, which means closing sales hires fast](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/stakeholder-priorities-recruiting-alignment). [Engineering leaders care about technical bar and cultural fit](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/technical-recruiting-engineering-leader-priorities). [Finance cares about cost control and budget predictability](https://www.ere.net/cfo-recruiting-priorities-understanding).

[When you understand what stakeholders value, you can position recruiting as helping them achieve their goals](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/stakeholder-alignment-organizational-success), not as something that competes for their attention and resources.

## Set Expectations Proactively

[Most recruiting frustration comes from mismatched expectations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/expectation-management-recruiting-success-factor). [Hiring managers think recruiting takes two weeks. Leadership thinks offers should be accepted automatically. Executives think you can just "find more candidates"](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-expectations-reality-gaps).

[Educate early and often about realistic timelines, market conditions, and recruiting constraints](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-expectation-setting-stakeholder-communication):

"For this senior engineering role, realistic timeline is 8-12 weeks from kick-off to offer acceptance. [Industry data shows](https://www.lever.co/blog/time-to-hire-benchmarks-2025/) senior technical roles take 60-90 days on average. We'll aim for the faster end, but this helps set expectations."

"Our current compensation range is 20% below market for this role based on [Pave benchmarking data](https://www.pave.com/). We can proceed with this range, but expect longer time-to-fill and lower offer acceptance rates. If we adjust to market median, we significantly improve our odds."

"For passive candidates, expect 5-7 touchpoints before they'll engage seriously. [Research from Gem shows](https://www.gem.com/blog/passive-candidate-engagement-timeline-2025) that passive candidate outreach cycles take 4-8 weeks. This is normal and we'll keep you updated on progress."

[Setting realistic expectations upfront prevents frustration later](https://hbr.com/2017/08/how-to-set-expectations-with-your-team-and-your-boss). [When things take as long as you said they would, you look credible](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-credibility-building-stakeholder-trust). [When you "beat" your own timeline estimates, you look like a rockstar](https://www.ere.net/recruiter-performance-perception-expectation-management).

## Ask for What You Need Directly

[Here's a radical concept: tell your leadership what you need to be successful](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-resource-needs-communication). [Most don't ask directly, then complain they don't have resources](https://hbr.com/2020/09/ask-for-what-you-need-at-work). [Your leadership isn't psychic—they won't know you need help unless you tell them](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2024/03/asking-for-resources-professional-communication/).

[Be specific and tie requests to outcomes](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-resource-requests-business-justification):

"To hit our Q1 hiring targets, I need [specific resource: LinkedIn Recruiter license, sourcing support, faster offer approval process]. [Here's the impact that would have](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-resource-requests-roi-quantification): [specific metric improvement]. [Here's what it costs](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-budget-requests-cost-benefit-analysis): [specific dollar amount]. [Here's the ROI](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-investment-roi-calculation): [specific business outcome]."

[Leadership can say yes or no, but at least you asked clearly](https://hbr.com/2018/12/how-to-ask-for-what-you-need-at-work). [Most recruiters never ask, then wonder why they don't have resources](https://www.ere.net/recruiter-resource-constraints-self-advocacy-importance).

## Document Everything

[When leadership makes decisions that impact recruiting, document them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-decision-documentation-cya-strategy). [Not to be petty—to protect yourself and provide accountability](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-documentation-professional-protection).

[Leadership says to keep compensation below market? Document it: "Per our conversation on [date], we're proceeding with compensation at [amount], which is [X%] below market per [data source]. We expect this will extend time-to-fill by [estimate] and reduce offer acceptance rates. I'll track impact and report back."](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-decisions-documentation-accountability-protection)

[Now when the role takes three months to fill and leadership asks why, you have documentation showing you flagged the issue and predicted the outcome](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/decision-documentation-career-protection). [You're not saying "I told you so"—you're demonstrating you saw the issue coming and communicated it proactively](https://hbr.com/2019/09/how-to-disagree-with-your-boss).

## The Weekly Update Hack

[Send a weekly recruiting update to your stakeholders](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-stakeholder-communication-cadence). [Keep it short—bullet points, key metrics, wins, challenges, asks](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-status-update-format-templates). [This accomplishes multiple things](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recurring-recruiting-updates-stakeholder-management):

1. [Keeps recruiting visible and top-of-mind](https://hbr.com/2021/05/make-your-work-more-visible)
2. [Shows you're proactive and organized](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-professional-brand-building)
3. [Surfaces issues before they become crises](https://www.ere.net/proactive-problem-surfacing-recruiting-leadership)
4. [Makes it easy for leadership to advocate for you](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/executive-sponsorship-career-advancement) (they have current data to reference)
5. [Creates documentation trail of your communication](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/communication-documentation-professional-protection)

[Template](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-update-email-templates):

## The Bottom Line

[Managing up as a recruiter means educating your leadership about recruiting realities, framing everything in business impact terms, building cross-functional relationships, setting realistic expectations, and documenting decisions](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/managing-up-recruiters-comprehensive-guide). [It's not manipulation—it's professional communication that helps leadership make better decisions about talent](https://hbr.com/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up).

[Your technical recruiting skills matter, but your ability to manage stakeholders determines whether you can actually use those skills effectively](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-success-factors-stakeholder-management-priority). [The best sourcers in the world can't succeed if their leadership won't approve competitive offers or their hiring managers take two weeks to interview candidates](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-effectiveness-stakeholder-constraints).

[Invest time in managing up deliberately](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2023/12/managing-up-career-investment/). [Train your leadership to support recruiting effectively](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/stakeholder-training-recruiting-success). [They'll think they're just making good business decisions, but really you're running a masterclass in how recruiting actually works](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/influence-without-authority-organizational-effectiveness).

[And when they finally "get it" and start advocating for recruiting needs without you asking? That's when you know you've successfully managed up](https://hbr.com/2022/04/signs-youre-successfully-managing-up). [Enjoy that moment, because you earned it](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiter-career-wins-stakeholder-advocacy).
