Your best candidate just accepted your offer. You're celebrating. Then they call: "My current employer made a counter-offer. Can we talk?"

Most recruiters panic at this point. They either start negotiating against the counter-offer or try to guilt the candidate into sticking with their commitment. Both approaches fail.

Here's how to handle counter-offers strategically—starting with preventing them before they happen.

## Why Most Counter-Offers Work (And Why That's Your Fault)

Candidates accept counter-offers because you didn't address their real reasons for leaving. It's that simple.

**If someone is leaving primarily for money**, a counter-offer will work. They'll take more money to stay somewhere familiar.

**If someone is leaving because they're bored, unchallenged, or stuck**, a counter-offer won't work. No amount of money fixes that.

Your job during the interview process is to figure out which situation you're dealing with.

## The Questions That Predict Counter-Offer Risk

Ask these questions during your first conversation with every candidate:

**"If your current employer offered you more money to stay, would you take it?"**
Direct. Uncomfortable. Necessary. Their answer tells you everything.

**"Have you told your manager you're looking?"**
If no: why not? If they're afraid of the conversation, they're probably not serious about leaving.

**"What would need to change at your current company for you to stop looking?"**
Listen carefully. If they describe changes that could happen with a counter-offer (more money, promotion, new project), you're at risk.

**"When you imagine yourself in six months, do you see yourself at your current company or somewhere new?"**
People who are emotionally done won't go back. People who are "just exploring" will.

**"Have you left jobs before? How did those companies react?"**
If they've been counter-offered before, they're likely to be counter-offered again. And if they accepted previous counter-offers, they'll probably do it again.

## The Counter-Offer Prevention Strategy (Do This BEFORE The Offer)

Don't wait until offer acceptance to address counter-offers. Handle it proactively:

**During the interview process**, ask: "Most candidates get counter-offers when they resign. If that happens to you, how will you handle it?"

Make them think through the scenario before it happens. Candidates who mentally commit to leaving are less likely to change their minds.

**Before you make an offer**, say: "I want to make sure you're serious about making a move. What would you do if your current employer made a counter-offer?"

If they hesitate or say "it depends," don't make an offer yet. Have a deeper conversation about what they actually want.

**When they accept your offer**, say: "Congratulations! Most people get counter-offers when they resign. Let's talk through what that might look like and how you'll respond."

Walk through the counter-offer conversation before it happens. This isn't manipulation—it's preparation.

## What To Say When The Counter-Offer Happens

The candidate calls you: their current employer made a counter-offer. Here's your response:

**Don't panic.**
Stay calm. This is normal. Your energy matters.

**Don't guilt them.**
"You already accepted our offer, you made a commitment" doesn't work. People don't stay at jobs out of guilt.

**Don't immediately try to outbid the counter-offer.**
If you increase your offer, you're teaching the candidate that threats work. Bad precedent.

Instead, ask questions:

**"What did they offer you?"**
Understand what you're competing against. Money? Promotion? New responsibilities?

**"Why do you think they're making this offer now, when they didn't address these things before you resigned?"**
Let them realize their company only acted when forced.

**"If you accept their counter-offer, what will be different in six months?"**
Help them see that counter-offers rarely fix the underlying reasons people leave.

**"What made you start looking in the first place?"**
Remind them why they wanted to leave. Did the counter-offer address that?

**"How do you think your manager will view you after this?"**
Once you've threatened to leave, you're a flight risk. That affects future promotions, projects, and trust.

## The Statistics You Should Share (When Appropriate)

If the candidate is seriously considering the counter-offer, share these data points:

- Studies show that 50-80% of people who accept counter-offers leave within six months anyway
- Accepting a counter-offer often damages the relationship with the manager (you threatened to leave, they won't forget)
- Counter-offers are usually a short-term fix to avoid the pain of replacing you—not a genuine investment in your career
- The reasons you wanted to leave will still be there after the excitement of the counter-offer wears off

Don't recite statistics robotically. Use them to help the candidate think critically.

## When To Walk Away From The Candidate

Sometimes, you should let them go. Here's when:

**If they're primarily motivated by money and the counter-offer is substantially higher**: You don't want to start a bidding war or hire someone who'll leave as soon as someone offers more.

**If they accepted your offer but are now "not sure"**: This person isn't ready to commit. They'll be a retention risk from day one.

**If they're using your offer to negotiate a counter-offer**: Some candidates interview just to get leverage with their current employer. Don't be their negotiation tool.

**If you sense they're emotionally not ready to leave**: They might accept your offer and then quit in three months because they weren't truly committed.

Say: "It sounds like you have a tough decision to make. Take the time you need. If you decide to stay, I totally understand. If you decide to move forward with us, let me know. Either way, best of luck."

Then stop pursuing them. Desperate recruiting creates bad hires.

## How To Strengthen Your Position Against Counter-Offers

**Sell the future, not just the present**: Counter-offers usually match current comp. Your advantage is the career trajectory, growth opportunities, and culture your company offers. Emphasize that.

**Build relationships beyond the offer**: If the candidate has connected with future team members, hiring managers, and leadership, they're less likely to back out. One relationship (with you) is easier to walk away from than five.

**Get them excited about the work**: Money keeps people. Mission and impact inspire them. If your candidate is excited about what they'll build at your company, a counter-offer is less tempting.

**Move quickly**: The longer the process drags, the more time their current employer has to intervene. Fast processes reduce counter-offer risk.

**Address concerns early**: If comp is below their expectations, deal with it before the offer stage. If career progression is unclear, clarify it early. Don't let these become counter-offer leverage points.

## The Follow-Up After They Decline The Counter-Offer

If the candidate rejects the counter-offer and commits to your company, have this conversation:

"I'm glad you're still moving forward with us. That was probably a tough conversation with your manager. How are you feeling about your decision?"

Validate their choice. Reassure them. Make sure they're confident, not anxious.

Then: "Let's talk about your resignation timeline. What's your plan for transitioning your work?"

Keep them focused on the logistics of leaving, not the emotions. Forward momentum prevents second-guessing.

## The Bottom Line

Counter-offers happen. They're part of recruiting. But if you're losing more than 20-30% of accepted offers to counter-offers, you're doing something wrong.

**The fix:**
- Address counter-offers proactively during the interview process
- Understand the candidate's real reasons for leaving (not just surface-level answers)
- Ask direct questions about counter-offer risk before making offers
- When counter-offers happen, ask questions instead of panicking
- Know when to walk away from candidates who aren't truly committed
- Build relationships and excitement that make counter-offers less appealing

Counter-offers aren't the problem. Candidates who are only leaving for money, or who aren't truly committed to leaving, are the problem. Your job is to identify those candidates before you invest time and make offers.

**The Fast Version:**
- Ask about counter-offer risk during first conversation
- Have candidates commit to how they'll handle counter-offers before accepting your offer
- When counter-offers happen, ask questions to help candidates think critically
- Don't panic, guilt, or immediately increase your offer
- Know when to walk away from candidates who aren't truly committed
- Strengthen your position by selling future opportunity, not just current comp
