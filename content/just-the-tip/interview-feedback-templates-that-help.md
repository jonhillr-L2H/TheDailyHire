You send a candidate through four rounds of interviews. You're ready to make a decision. You pull up the interview feedback and it says:

"Candidate seemed fine. No major red flags. I'd be okay with them."

**This feedback is useless.** "Fine" doesn't tell you if this person will succeed in the role. "No major red flags" doesn't help you compare three "fine" candidates. "I'd be okay with them" isn't a ringing endorsement.

[Bad interview feedback leads to bad hiring decisions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-feedback-best-practices). Here's how to fix it with better templates that force interviewers to give you actual signal.

## The Problem With Most Interview Feedback

Most interview feedback forms ask open-ended questions like:

- "What did you think of the candidate?"
- "Would you recommend moving forward?"
- "Any concerns?"

These questions produce **vague, unhelpful responses** because:

1. Interviewers don't know what "good" feedback looks like
2. [They're busy and default to quick, surface-level answers](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/common-interview-feedback-mistakes)
3. They're trying to avoid saying anything controversial
4. There's no structure forcing them to evaluate specific criteria

**Better approach:** Give interviewers a template that guides them to provide specific, actionable feedback.

## Template #1: The Specific Evidence Format

Force interviewers to provide **concrete examples** instead of general impressions.

**The template:**

```
Role: [Job Title]
Interviewer: [Name]
Date: [Date]

## What specific skills or qualities did this candidate demonstrate?
(Provide at least 2 examples with evidence)

Example 1:
Skill/Quality: [e.g., Problem-solving]
Evidence: [Specific thing they said or did that demonstrated this]

Example 2:
Skill/Quality: [e.g., Communication]
Evidence: [Specific thing they said or did that demonstrated this]

## What specific concerns or gaps did you observe?
(Provide at least 1 example with evidence)

Concern 1:
Gap: [e.g., Limited experience with X]
Evidence: [What they said/didn't say that surfaced this]

## Overall recommendation:
☐ Strong Yes - I would be excited to work with this person
☐ Yes - I think they'd be successful in the role
☐ No - I have significant concerns about their fit
☐ Strong No - I would not recommend moving forward

## What would you need to see/hear to change your recommendation?
[Specific information that would address your concerns]
```

**Why this works:**

- "Provide at least 2 examples" prevents lazy one-word answers
- [Requiring evidence forces interviewers to reference actual things the candidate said](https://www.lever.co/blog/structured-interview-feedback-forms)
- The "what would change your mind" question surfaces whether concerns are dealbreakers or just gaps
- Clear recommendation options prevent "maybe" responses

## Template #2: The Role-Specific Criteria Format

Create feedback forms **tailored to each role** with specific competencies you're evaluating.

**Example for a Senior Software Engineer role:**

```
Candidate: [Name]
Role: Senior Software Engineer
Interviewer: [Name]

Rate each criterion (1-5 scale):
1 = Well below expectations
2 = Below expectations
3 = Meets expectations
4 = Exceeds expectations
5 = Far exceeds expectations
N/A = Not evaluated in my interview

Technical Skills:
☐ Code quality and architecture decisions [1-5 or N/A]
Evidence/Notes:

☐ Problem-solving approach [1-5 or N/A]
Evidence/Notes:

☐ System design thinking [1-5 or N/A]
Evidence/Notes:

Collaboration:
☐ Communication clarity [1-5 or N/A]
Evidence/Notes:

☐ Teamwork and collaboration examples [1-5 or N/A]
Evidence/Notes:

☐ Mentorship potential [1-5 or N/A]
Evidence/Notes:

Role-Specific:
☐ [Specific technology/framework experience] [1-5 or N/A]
Evidence/Notes:

☐ Experience with [domain-specific requirement] [1-5 or N/A]
Evidence/Notes:

Overall Assessment:
Would you want this person on your team?
☐ Absolutely - Strong hire
☐ Yes - Would be a good addition
☐ No - Concerns outweigh strengths
☐ Absolutely not - Would not recommend

Most impressive thing about this candidate:

Biggest concern about this candidate:
```

**Why this works:**

- [Role-specific criteria ensure you're evaluating what actually matters](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/competency-based-interview-feedback) for this position
- Rating scales force differentiation between candidates
- N/A option acknowledges not every interviewer evaluates every skill
- "Most impressive" and "biggest concern" require reflection, not checkbox filling

## Template #3: The Comparison Format (For Tight Decisions)

When you're down to 2-3 final candidates and need to differentiate them, use this:

```
You interviewed [Candidate A], [Candidate B], and [Candidate C] for [Role].

Rank them (1 = top choice, 2 = second choice, 3 = third choice):
[Candidate A]: ___
[Candidate B]: ___
[Candidate C]: ___

Why did you rank your #1 candidate first?
(What specific strengths do they have that the others don't?)

What concerns do you have about your #1 candidate?
(What might make them unsuccessful?)

If we can't get your #1 candidate, would you be excited about #2?
☐ Yes, they're almost as strong
☐ They're acceptable but there's a meaningful gap
☐ No, I would recommend we keep looking

What's the biggest difference between your #1 and #2?
```

**Why this works:**

- [Forced ranking makes interviewers commit to a preference](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/comparing-candidates-interview-feedback)
- You see whether there's clear consensus or split opinions
- The "biggest difference" question surfaces what actually matters in the decision
- "Would you be excited about #2" tells you if #2 is a real option or just "fine"

## Template #4: The Red Flag / Green Flag Format

Simple, fast, and forces interviewers to be specific about concerns.

```
Candidate: [Name]
Role: [Job Title]
Interviewer: [Name]

🟢 Green Flags (Things that make you confident they'd succeed):
1.
2.
3.

🔴 Red Flags (Concerns that make you hesitate):
1.
2.
3.

⚠️ Yellow Flags (Things you're unsure about and want more signal on):
1.
2.

Are any of your red flags dealbreakers?
☐ Yes - Which ones: _____
☐ No - They're concerns but could be addressed

Recommendation:
☐ Move forward
☐ Move forward with reservations (specify): _____
☐ Do not move forward
```

**Why this works:**

- Visual (flags) makes it easy to scan feedback quickly
- [Separating red/yellow/green forces nuance](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/structured-feedback-hiring-decisions) instead of "they're fine"
- "Are any dealbreakers" helps you know which concerns are actually serious
- "Move forward with reservations" captures the middle ground many interviewers feel

## Template #5: The Debrief Discussion Guide

For interview debriefs, give the team a structured discussion format instead of free-form conversation.

**The structure:**

```
Interview Debrief: [Candidate Name] for [Role]

Round 1: Quick Gut Reactions (2 minutes)
Each interviewer shares their overall impression in one sentence.
No discussion yet—just capture first impressions.

Round 2: Strengths (10 minutes)
Go around: What are this candidate's 2-3 strongest qualities?
What evidence supports this?

Round 3: Concerns (10 minutes)
Go around: What are your biggest concerns about this candidate?
Are these dealbreakers or gaps that can be addressed?

Round 4: Role Fit (5 minutes)
Discuss: Do they have what it takes to be successful in THIS specific role?
What's the strongest evidence they'll succeed?
What's the biggest risk they won't?

Round 5: Decision (5 minutes)
Vote:
☐ Strong Yes - Make an offer
☐ Yes - Move forward if no better options
☐ No - Do not move forward
☐ Need more information - Schedule additional interview

Final decision: _____
Next steps: _____
```

**Why this works:**

- [Structured discussion prevents one loud voice from dominating](https://www.lever.co/blog/running-effective-interview-debriefs)
- Separating strengths and concerns ensures balanced evaluation
- Timed rounds keep discussions focused
- Vote at the end forces commitment

## How To Get Interviewers To Actually Use These Templates

Having great templates doesn't help if interviewers ignore them. Here's how to get adoption:

### 1. Make It Mandatory (And Enforceable)

**Rule:** Interview feedback must be submitted within 24 hours using the template. No exceptions.

No feedback = No participation in the hiring decision = No ability to veto candidates later.

[If people know they can't influence the decision without submitting proper feedback](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-feedback-accountability), they'll submit proper feedback.

### 2. Train Interviewers On What Good Feedback Looks Like

Show examples of bad vs. good feedback:

**Bad:**
"Candidate was okay. No red flags. I'd be fine with them."

**Good:**
"Candidate demonstrated strong problem-solving when I asked about [specific scenario]. They walked through [specific approach] and identified [specific trade-offs]. Concern: They haven't worked with [technology] before, which could create a learning curve in the first 2-3 months. Not a dealbreaker if they have ramp-up support."

[When people see what you're looking for, they're more likely to provide it](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/training-interviewers-better-feedback).

### 3. Give Feedback On Feedback

When someone submits vague feedback, send it back:

"Thanks for the feedback. Can you provide specific examples for your assessment? For instance, what did the candidate say that made you think they have strong communication skills?"

[People learn quickly when you hold them accountable](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/improving-interview-feedback-quality).

### 4. Make Templates Easy To Access

Put templates:
- In your ATS (auto-populated for each interview)
- In a shared Google Doc/Notion page
- In your interview scheduling emails as a reminder

Don't make people hunt for the template. [Make it the default, easiest option](https://www.lever.co/blog/integrating-feedback-forms-ats).

## The Feedback That Never Helps (And Should Be Banned)

Some feedback is worse than no feedback. Ban these phrases:

❌ "They were fine" - Not specific enough
❌ "I liked them" - Personal preference, not evaluation
❌ "No red flags" - Doesn't tell you what's GREEN
❌ "Good culture fit" - [Vague and potentially biased](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/culture-fit-bias-concerns)
❌ "Strong candidate" - Compared to what?
❌ "I'd be okay with them" - Damning with faint praise

Replace these with **specific observations and evidence**.

## What To Do When Feedback Conflicts

You'll get conflicting feedback. That's normal. Here's how to handle it:

**Scenario: Two interviewers have opposite assessments**

**Option 1:** Look at what they evaluated. [Did they assess different things](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/resolving-conflicting-interview-feedback)? Maybe one focused on technical skills (strong) and one on communication (weak). Both can be true.

**Option 2:** Weight feedback based on expertise. [The engineering manager's technical assessment](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/weighting-interview-feedback) probably matters more than the recruiter's.

**Option 3:** Get more signal. If feedback is split, add another interview or reference check to break the tie.

## The Bottom Line

Interview feedback is only useful if it helps you make better hiring decisions.

**Useful feedback:**
- Is specific and evidence-based
- Evaluates criteria that matter for the role
- Surfaces both strengths and concerns
- Enables comparison between candidates
- Makes recommendations clear

**Useless feedback:**
- Is vague ("they were fine")
- Relies on gut feelings without evidence
- Avoids taking a clear position
- Provides no differentiation between candidates

Fix your feedback templates and you'll make better, faster hiring decisions. Keep using vague forms and you'll keep getting vague answers.

Your call.
