Recruiter follow-up is an art that most people get completely wrong. [Either you ghost candidates for weeks, or you send 47 emails in 3 days like a desperate ex trying to "just talk"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/candidate-communication-best-practices). Both approaches tank your credibility and your conversion rates.

Here's how to follow up in a way that keeps candidates engaged without making them block your number.

## The Golden Rule: Set Expectations Upfront

[The single biggest mistake recruiters make is not telling candidates what to expect](https://www.ere.net/candidate-experience-communication-expectations/).

At the end of every conversation, say exactly this: "I'll reach out by [specific day] with an update, even if I don't have a final decision yet. If you don't hear from me by then, feel free to ping me."

**Why this works:**
- Candidates know when to expect contact (reduces anxiety)
- You've given yourself a deadline (increases accountability)
- You've given them permission to follow up (reduces awkwardness)

[Research shows that candidates who know what to expect are 3X more likely to stay engaged in the process](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/candidate-experience-communication).

## The Follow-Up Timeline That Actually Works

Here's the specific cadence that maintains engagement without being annoying:

**After initial phone screen:** Follow up within 24-48 hours. [If you're moving forward, schedule the next interview immediately](https://recruitingdaily.com/speed-wins-recruiting/). If you're passing, send a polite rejection. If you're still deciding, say that: "Still reviewing other candidates. I'll have an update for you by Friday."

**Between interview rounds:** Follow up within 2-3 business days max. [Top candidates have other options, and every day of silence increases the chance they accept another offer](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/speed-to-hire-statistics).

**After final interview:** Follow up within 1 week. [If your process takes longer than a week to make decisions, you're losing candidates to faster-moving companies](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/time-to-hire-benchmarks-2025). Period.

**If there's a delay:** [Don't ghost. Send a quick update: "Decision is taking longer than expected due to [real reason]. I'll have an update by [date]. Still very interested in you."](https://www.ere.net/managing-hiring-delays-candidate-communication/)

## What To Actually Say In Follow-Ups

**The "checking in" message (use sparingly):**
```
"Hi [Name], wanted to check in on your timeline. Are you still interested in the [Role] position? I'm planning to move forward with next steps this week and wanted to make sure you're still in the mix."
```

**Why it works:** [Direct, low-pressure, shows you respect their time and choices](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/effective-recruiter-messages).

**The "status update" message:**
```
"Hi [Name], quick update: We're still finalizing our decision and should have an answer by end of week. I know the timeline has stretched a bit—thanks for your patience. Let me know if anything changes on your end."
```

**Why it works:** [Acknowledges the delay, gives a specific timeline, keeps the door open for them to share competing offers](https://recruitingdaily.com/keeping-candidates-engaged-during-delays/).

**The "we're still interested" message:**
```
"Hi [Name], just wanted to reach out since it's been a couple weeks. We're still very interested and working through internal approvals. I don't want you to think we've ghosted. Should have a final decision by [date]. How's your search going?"
```

**Why it works:** [Explicitly addresses ghosting concern, reaffirms interest, asks about their situation to gauge urgency](https://www.ere.net/candidate-nurture-during-long-hiring-processes/).

## When Candidates Go Silent On You

Sometimes you're the one chasing responses. Here's how to handle it:

**First follow-up (3 days after no response):**
```
"Hi [Name], following up on my message from [day]. Would love to chat about the [Role] opportunity. Let me know if you're still interested and what your availability looks like this week."
```

**Second follow-up (1 week later):**
```
"Hi [Name], wanted to try one more time. If you're no longer interested or your situation has changed, totally understand—just let me know so I can update my notes. If you are still interested, I'd love to connect this week."
```

**Third follow-up (DON'T):** [After two attempts with no response, they're either not interested or dealing with something that makes them unavailable](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/when-to-stop-following-up-candidates). Either way, move on. [Continuing to chase makes you look desperate and annoys candidates](https://www.askamanager.org/2024/09/recruiter-follow-up-how-many-is-too-many.html).

## What NOT To Do

**Don't:** Send vague "just checking in" messages with no new information. [These are useless and annoying](https://www.ere.net/candidate-communication-mistakes/).

**Don't:** Call candidates multiple times in one day unless it's genuinely urgent (like "we need an answer in 2 hours").

**Don't:** Use guilt trips. "I've reached out 3 times and haven't heard back" makes you sound passive-aggressive, not professional.

**Don't:** Follow up more than once per week unless there's new information or a specific reason. [Pestering candidates doesn't make them more interested—it makes them less](https://recruitingdaily.com/recruiter-communication-frequency/).

**Don't:** Only reach out when you need something. [If you've been silent for 6 months and suddenly pop up with "hey, are you still looking?"—that's transparent and annoying](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/talent-relationship-management).

## The Pro Move: Keep Candidates Warm

[The best recruiters maintain relationships with strong candidates even when there's no immediate opportunity](https://www.ere.net/talent-pipeline-relationship-building/).

**Monthly check-in for pipeline candidates:**
```
"Hi [Name], hope you're doing well. No specific role to discuss right now, but I wanted to stay in touch. How are things at [Company]? Let me know if you're ever open to exploring new opportunities."
```

**Sharing relevant content:**
```
"Saw this article about [topic relevant to their role] and thought of you. Hope things are going well!"
```

[This keeps you top of mind so when they are ready to move, you're the first call they make](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/staying-connected-with-candidates).

## The Bottom Line

[Great follow-up is consistent, respectful, and adds value](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/candidate-experience-communication). Set expectations, hit your deadlines, keep candidates informed even when there's no news.

The recruiters who convert the most candidates aren't the ones who follow up most aggressively—[they're the ones who communicate clearly, follow through on commitments, and respect candidates' time](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-experience-best-practices-2025).

That's the tip. Use it.

**Quick Reference:**

- **Set expectations:** Always end conversations with specific next steps and timeline
- **Follow-up cadence:** 24-48 hours after phone screen, 2-3 days between interviews, max 1 week after final
- **If they ghost:** Two follow-ups max, then move on
- **Stay in touch:** Monthly check-ins with pipeline candidates keep relationships warm
- **Never:** Send "just checking in" messages with no new information or value
