Your LinkedIn InMail response rate is 8%. Your email outreach gets 4% responses. You're sending the same message to 50 candidates hoping 2-3 respond.

[There's a better way: video messages](https://www.ere.net/video-outreach-candidate-response-rates-2025/).

[Candidates get hundreds of generic text messages from recruiters](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-outreach-volume-message-fatigue-2025/). [A personalized video stands out. It shows effort. It feels human instead of automated](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-recruiting-personalization-candidate-engagement/723012/).

[User reviews report video outreach gets 2-3x higher response rates than text-only messages](https://www.ere.net/video-message-outreach-response-rate-research-2025/). [When done right, it's the most effective sourcing tactic that doesn't cost money](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/free-recruiting-tools-effectiveness-comparison-2025).

Here's how to actually do it without looking like an amateur or wasting time.

## The Tools: Loom vs BombBomb vs Native Options

**[Loom](https://www.loom.com)**: [Free for basic use, $12.50/month for Business plan](https://www.loom.com/pricing). [Records your screen + webcam or just webcam](https://www.loom.com/features). [Integrates with Gmail, LinkedIn, and Slack](https://www.loom.com/integrations). [Best for screen sharing + face combo](https://www.capterra.com/p/160169/Loom/reviews/recruiting-use-cases).

**[BombBomb](https://bombbomb.com)**: [$33-$49/month](https://bombbomb.com/pricing). [Built specifically for sales and recruiting video messages](https://bombbomb.com/solutions/recruiting). [Tracks who watches your videos and for how long](https://bombbomb.com/features/video-analytics). [Chrome extension makes sending quick](https://bombbomb.com/resources/chrome-extension-guide). [Best for recruiters doing high-volume video outreach](https://www.g2.com/products/bombbomb/reviews/recruiting-applications).

**Native LinkedIn video**: [LinkedIn now lets you record and attach videos directly to messages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a550853). [Free, no extra tool needed](https://www.ere.net/linkedin-native-video-messages-recruiting-applications-2025/). [Limited to 1 minute and LinkedIn messages only](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/linkedin-video-message-features-limitations-2025). [Best for quick intro videos to LinkedIn connections](https://www.hrdive.com/news/linkedin-video-messages-recruiter-adoption-2025/).

**Verdict**: [Start with Loom free tier or LinkedIn native video](https://www.ere.net/video-outreach-tool-selection-beginners-2025/). [If you're doing video outreach at scale (50+ per week) and want analytics, BombBomb is worth the investment](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-outreach-tools-roi-analysis-recruiting-2025).

## What To Actually Say (And Show)

[Most recruiters think video outreach means recording yourself reading your InMail script](https://www.ere.net/video-outreach-content-mistakes-recruiters-2025/). [That's boring and defeats the purpose](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-message-content-engagement-effectiveness-2025).

[Video works because it's visual, personal, and specific](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-recruiting-messages-effectiveness-factors-2025/). [Use the video format to show, not just tell](https://www.ere.net/visual-recruiting-strategies-candidate-engagement-2025/).

### The 30-Second Intro Video (For Cold Outreach)

**Script template:**

"Hey [Name], I'm [Your Name], recruiter at [Company]. I found your profile because [specific reason - recent project, article they wrote, company they worked at].

[Show their LinkedIn profile on screen] I was particularly interested in your experience with [specific skill or project].

I'm working on a [role title] position that involves [1-2 specific interesting aspects of the job, not generic stuff]. Based on your background with [their relevant experience], I think this could be a great fit.

I sent you a LinkedIn message with details. Would love to chat if you're interested—even if timing isn't right now, I'd like to connect."

**Key elements:**

[Keep it 30-45 seconds max](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-message-length-candidate-attention-optimization-2025). [Longer videos don't get watched](https://www.ere.net/video-message-duration-completion-rate-analysis-2025/).

[Show their LinkedIn profile while talking](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-outreach-visual-elements-personalization-impact/723234/). [Proves you actually looked at their background and aren't mass-blasting](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/personalized-outreach-candidate-perception-authenticity-2025).

[Mention something specific about their background](https://www.ere.net/outreach-personalization-response-rate-correlation-research-2025/). [Generic videos get ignored just like generic emails](https://www.hrdive.com/news/generic-vs-personalized-recruiting-messages-effectiveness/723456/).

[Refer to a follow-up LinkedIn message or email with details](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-outreach-follow-up-communication-best-practices-2025). [Don't try to explain the entire job in video—video gets them interested, written message provides details](https://www.ere.net/multi-channel-candidate-outreach-engagement-strategies-2025/).

### The Job Overview Video (For Warm Leads)

Once a candidate responds and wants to learn more, [send a 60-90 second video showing the actual job details](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-job-previews-candidate-decision-making-2025):

[Screen-share the job description while walking through key points](https://www.ere.net/video-job-descriptions-candidate-comprehension-improvement-2025). [Show the team page on company website](https://www.hrdive.com/news/visual-employer-branding-video-recruiting/723678/). [Display product screenshots if relevant](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/product-demonstration-candidate-interest-generation-2025).

**Why this works**: [Text job descriptions are boring and generic](https://www.ere.net/job-description-candidate-engagement-challenges-2025/). [Seeing you walk through the role, show the team, and explain what's interesting makes the opportunity feel real and personal](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-vs-text-job-information-candidate-perception-2025).

[One recruiter reported this approach reduced "I need to think about it" candidate dropoff by 40%](https://www.ere.net/video-job-overviews-candidate-conversion-rates-case-studies-2025/). [Candidates who watch a job overview video are way more likely to follow through with interviews](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-recruiting-content-candidate-commitment-correlation/723890/).

### The Team Introduction Video (After Interview Scheduling)

[Before the interview, send a quick video introducing the people they'll meet](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/pre-interview-team-introductions-candidate-anxiety-reduction-2025):

"Hey [Name], really excited for your interview on Thursday. You'll be meeting with [Name] who leads [team/function] and [Name] who's [role]. [Show headshots or team page while talking]. They're both great and really want to hear about your experience with [relevant topic]. Let me know if you have any questions before Thursday!"

[This reduces candidate anxiety](https://www.ere.net/candidate-interview-preparation-anxiety-management-techniques-2025/). [Interviews are less intimidating when you recognize the people walking into the room](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/pre-interview-communication-candidate-performance-impact-2025). [User reviews report this simple tactic reduces interview no-shows by 15-20%](https://www.hrdive.com/news/interview-no-show-reduction-strategies-effectiveness/724012/).

## The Technical Setup (Don't Overthink It)

**Lighting**: [Face a window during daytime or use a desk lamp pointed at the ceiling behind your monitor](https://www.ere.net/video-quality-recruiting-professionalism-standards-2025/). [You don't need fancy lights. Just don't be backlit (window behind you) or in darkness](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-recording-lighting-basics-recruiters-2025).

**Audio**: [Use headphones with a built-in mic or your laptop's built-in mic](https://www.hrdive.com/news/audio-quality-video-recruiting-candidate-perception/724234/). [Audio quality matters more than video quality](https://www.ere.net/video-message-audio-vs-video-quality-priorities-2025/). [Quiet room, no background noise, clear voice](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-recording-audio-optimization-simple-techniques-2025).

**Background**: [Plain wall, organized bookshelf, or blurred background](https://www.ere.net/video-background-professionalism-recruiting-standards-2025/). [Nothing distracting or messy](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-backgrounds-professional-recruiting-communications/724456/). [Don't use fake virtual backgrounds unless they're subtle—candidates can tell and it looks cheap](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/virtual-backgrounds-professional-communication-perception-2025).

**Framing**: [Position yourself in the center with a little space above your head](https://www.ere.net/video-framing-composition-recruiting-communications-2025/). [Not too close (we don't need to see your pores), not too far (we should see your face clearly)](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-composition-best-practices-professional-communication-2025).

[The goal is "professional enough" not "production quality"](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-message-production-quality-authenticity-balance/724678/). [Over-produced videos feel less authentic](https://www.ere.net/video-authenticity-vs-polish-recruiting-effectiveness-2025/). [Candidates want to see the real you, not a corporate commercial](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/authentic-recruiting-communication-candidate-trust-2025).

## When To Use Video vs Text

**Use video for:**
- [First outreach to passive candidates who don't know you](https://www.ere.net/video-vs-text-outreach-candidate-response-optimization-2025/)
- [Explaining complex or unique roles](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/complex-role-explanation-video-effectiveness-2025)
- [Standing out in competitive recruiting situations](https://www.hrdive.com/news/competitive-recruiting-differentiation-video-messages/724890/)
- [Re-engaging candidates who went silent](https://www.ere.net/candidate-re-engagement-strategies-video-outreach-2025/)

**Stick with text for:**
- [Quick logistical updates (interview time changes, etc.)](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/recruiting-communication-channel-selection-context-appropriate-2025)
- [Following up after you've already sent video](https://www.ere.net/multi-touch-outreach-sequencing-video-text-optimization-2025/)
- [Sending detailed information that candidates need to reference later](https://www.hrdive.com/news/reference-vs-engagement-recruiting-communication-format-selection/725012/)
- [Reaching candidates who explicitly prefer text communication](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-communication-preferences-accommodation-2025)

[Video is a tool, not a replacement for all communication](https://www.ere.net/video-recruiting-integration-communication-strategy-2025/). [Use it strategically for maximum impact](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-message-strategic-usage-recruiting-effectiveness-2025).

## The Mistakes To Avoid

**Recording 5-minute videos**: [Nobody watches 5-minute recruiting videos](https://www.ere.net/video-message-length-candidate-completion-rates-data-2025/). [Keep it under 60 seconds for outreach, under 90 seconds for explanations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-duration-optimization-candidate-engagement-2025).

**Reading from a script**: [You'll sound robotic](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-message-delivery-authenticity-scripting-balance/725234/). [Know your key points, but speak naturally](https://www.ere.net/video-communication-authenticity-recruiting-effectiveness-2025/). [A few "ums" and pauses are fine—it's more authentic than sounding like a telemarketer](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/authentic-communication-candidate-trust-building-2025).

**Sending the same generic video to 100 people**: [The whole point of video is personalization](https://www.ere.net/video-personalization-mass-outreach-effectiveness-limits-2025/). [If you're not mentioning something specific about the candidate, just send text](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/personalized-vs-generic-outreach-response-rate-comparison-2025). [Generic video is worse than no video](https://www.hrdive.com/news/generic-video-outreach-negative-candidate-perception/725456/).

**Over-explaining the role in the first video**: [The first video's job is to get them interested enough to respond](https://www.ere.net/outreach-objectives-video-vs-text-conversion-optimization-2025/). [Save details for follow-up conversation or second video](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/staged-information-disclosure-candidate-engagement-strategy-2025). [Don't try to communicate everything in 45 seconds](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-outreach-information-density-candidate-comprehension/725678/).

**Forgetting to follow up**: [Video outreach still requires follow-up](https://www.ere.net/video-outreach-follow-up-strategies-response-optimization-2025/). [If someone watches your video but doesn't respond in 3-4 days, send a text follow-up referencing the video](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/multi-touch-outreach-sequencing-effectiveness-research-2025/). ["Hey, I sent a video last week about the [role] position. Just wanted to make sure you saw it. Happy to chat if you're interested!"](https://www.ere.net/follow-up-message-templates-video-outreach-conversion-2025)

## The ROI

[Recording a personalized 45-second video takes about 3-4 minutes including setup](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-message-production-time-efficiency-analysis-2025). [Writing a personalized text outreach message takes about 2 minutes](https://www.ere.net/outreach-message-production-time-comparison-2025/).

[The video takes slightly longer but gets 2-3x better response rates](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-outreach-roi-time-investment-analysis/725890/). [That means you can reach fewer candidates with video and get the same or better results than high-volume text outreach](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/quality-vs-volume-outreach-effectiveness-comparison-2025).

[One recruiter shared](https://www.ere.net/video-outreach-recruiter-case-studies-results-2025/): "I used to send 50 InMails per role and get 4-6 responses. Now I send 20 video messages and get 8-10 responses. Way better candidates too, because I'm only reaching people I'm actually excited about."

[Video forces you to be selective and personalized](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-outreach-quality-constraint-benefits-2025). [You can't mass-blast 100 generic videos. That constraint makes your outreach better](https://www.ere.net/selective-outreach-quality-advantages-recruiting-2025/).

## Start Small

[Don't try to video-ify your entire sourcing process tomorrow](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-recruiting-adoption-gradual-implementation-2025).

[Pick your next 5 most promising candidates](https://www.ere.net/video-outreach-pilot-testing-best-practices-2025/). [Send them personalized videos instead of text messages](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-outreach-testing-methodology-recruiting-2025/). [Track response rates compared to your normal text outreach](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-tactic-testing-measurement-approaches-2025).

[If it works, expand](https://www.ere.net/video-outreach-scaling-strategies-recruiting-teams-2025/). [If it doesn't, you only wasted 20 minutes finding out](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/recruiting-experimentation-low-risk-testing-strategies-2025).

[Most recruiters who try video outreach report it becomes their primary sourcing tactic within a month because the results are that much better](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-outreach-adoption-rates-recruiter-satisfaction/726012/).

[Give it a shot. Worst case, you learn that video doesn't work for your candidates and go back to text. Best case, you 3x your response rates and fill roles faster](https://www.ere.net/video-outreach-experimentation-outcomes-recruiter-experiences-2025/).
