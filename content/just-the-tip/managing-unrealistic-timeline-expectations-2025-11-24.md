Your hiring manager just asked you to fill a senior machine learning engineer role in two weeks. During the holidays. With below-market comp.

Sure, let me just pull that purple squirrel out of my festive hat.

Here's how to reset unrealistic timeline expectations without coming off as a roadblock or, worse, a pushover who promises miracles and delivers disappointments.

## Lead With Data, Not Excuses

Hiring managers don't respond to "that's really hard." They respond to numbers.

**Try this approach:**

"Based on our last three similar roles, time-to-fill averaged 47 days. With holiday scheduling, we're looking at 6-8 weeks realistically. Here's how we can accelerate that..."

Come prepared with:
- Average time-to-fill for similar roles
- Current market data on candidate availability
- Benchmark data from your ATS
- Competitor hiring timelines

Numbers aren't negotiable. Feelings are.

## Offer Solutions, Not Just Problems

Don't just say "that timeline won't work." That's a dead end.

**Reframe as options:**

"We can hit two weeks if we: (a) raise comp 15% above market, (b) reduce must-have requirements to three, or (c) consider candidates who need visa sponsorship. Which trade-off works for you?"

Now they're making decisions, not fighting you.

## The Magic Phrase

When a hiring manager insists on an impossible timeline, try this:

"I want to set expectations so we're celebrating together in 6 weeks, not frustrated together in 2 weeks. What does success look like for you if we can't hit that exact date?"

This shifts the conversation from confrontation to collaboration.

## The Bottom Line

Unrealistic timelines aren't malice—they're usually desperation wrapped in optimism.

Your job is to be the voice of reality without being the department of no. Lead with data. Offer trade-offs. Set expectations you can actually meet.

Under-promise, over-deliver. It's not just good recruiting—it's good foreplay for a long-term hiring manager relationship.

And yes, I said foreplay. You're welcome.
