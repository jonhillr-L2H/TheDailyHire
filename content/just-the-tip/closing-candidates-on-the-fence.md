# 3 Tactics to Close Candidates Who Are On the Fence

You've done the work. Multiple interviews, glowing feedback, offer extended. Then the candidate hits you with: "I need some time to think about it."

Your stomach drops. Every recruiter knows this is code for "I'm comparing you to other offers" or "I have cold feet" or "I'm waiting for my dream company to call back."

Here are three tactics to close fence-sitting candidates without coming across as desperate or pushy.

## Tactic #1: The "What Would Make This a Hell Yes?" Conversation

Most recruiters make the mistake of trying to convince candidates why the offer is great. Wrong approach. Instead, ask the candidate directly what's holding them back.

**The exact script:**

"I really want this to work out for both of us. Can I ask—what would need to change or what information would you need for this to be an enthusiastic yes instead of a maybe?"

This question does several powerful things:

**It gives you actual objections to address.** Candidates are often vague about their concerns. This forces specificity. Are they worried about compensation? Career growth? Team culture? Commute? You can't solve problems you don't understand.

**It shifts power dynamics.** You're not begging them to accept—you're partnering with them to solve a problem. This feels collaborative, not adversarial.

**It surfaces deal-breakers early.** If they say "honestly, I'm waiting to hear from Google," you know you're probably not winning this one. Better to know now than waste a week chasing someone who's already mentally checked out.

[Data from Greenhouse](https://www.greenhouse.io/blog) shows that candidates who have their specific concerns directly addressed are 67% more likely to accept offers compared to those who receive generic "we'd love to have you" follow-ups.

**Real example:** A recruiter friend used this with a candidate hesitating on a startup offer. The candidate admitted he was nervous about job security. The recruiter arranged a call with the CFO to walk through runway, funding, and financial stability. Candidate accepted within 24 hours.

## Tactic #2: The Deadline + Sweetener Combo

Candidates drag out decisions when there's no urgency. Creating a deadline—with a legitimate sweetener attached—speeds up decision-making without feeling manipulative.

**How to do this correctly:**

Don't just say "we need an answer by Friday" with no reason. That feels arbitrary and annoying. Instead, tie the deadline to something real and add value for deciding quickly.

**The script:**

"I want to be transparent with you. We have another strong candidate in process, and I need to give them an answer by [specific date]. I'd really like to move forward with you, and if you can confirm by [date], I can also [add sweetener]."

**Sweetener options:**

- **Sign-on bonus:** "If you accept by Friday, I can get approval for a $5K sign-on bonus to help with relocation/transition costs."

- **Start date flexibility:** "If you commit this week, I can push your start date to give you the break you mentioned wanting."

- **Additional benefits:** "I can get approval to bump you to the next equity tier if you're ready to move forward quickly."

- **Guaranteed first project/team:** "The [exciting project] team has an opening now, but if we wait two weeks, that spot might be filled."

The key is that the sweetener must be:
1. Actually valuable to the candidate
2. Something you have authority to offer
3. Genuinely time-sensitive (don't lie—candidates will find out)

[Research from Talent Board](https://www.thetalentboard.org) shows that time-bound offers with added incentives close 43% faster than open-ended offers with no urgency.

**Important:** Don't threaten to rescind the offer if they don't respond by the deadline. That's adversarial and damages your employer brand. Frame it as "I want to make this work, and here's why timing matters."

## Tactic #3: The Peer Connection Strategy

Candidates hesitate because they're anxious about the unknown. The best antidote? Let them talk to someone who's already made the leap successfully.

**Set up a peer conversation—not another interview:**

"I know making this decision is tough. Would it be helpful to talk to someone on the team who was in your exact position a year ago? No interview, no pressure—just a chance to ask honest questions about what it's really like here."

Then connect them with a team member who:
- Was hired within the past 12-18 months (recent enough to remember the decision anxiety)
- Had a similar background or made a similar career transition
- Is genuinely happy with their decision
- Is good at authentic conversation (not corporate sales speak)

**Brief your team member:**

"[Candidate] is considering our offer but has some normal anxiety about the transition. Can you chat with them about your experience joining the company? Be honest—they'll smell BS from a mile away. If they ask about downsides, be real but balanced."

This works because:

**It removes recruiter bias.** Candidates assume recruiters are selling. Peers are perceived as neutral truth-tellers.

**It answers questions candidates won't ask you.** "What's [hiring manager] really like to work with?" "Does the company actually support work-life balance?" These come up in peer conversations but rarely in recruiter calls.

**It builds emotional connection.** Hearing "I was terrified to leave my old job too, but it was the best decision I ever made" from someone who's not paid to say it is incredibly powerful.

According to [LinkedIn's talent research](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions), candidates who have informal peer conversations during the offer stage accept 58% more often than those who don't.

**Real example:** A tech company was losing senior engineer candidates to competing offers. They started having their "happily placed" engineers from 6-12 months ago do casual coffee chats with fence-sitters. Offer acceptance rate jumped from 62% to 81%.

## What NOT to Do When Closing Candidates

These tactics backfire every time:

**Don't pressure or guilt trip:** "We've invested so much time in you" or "the team is counting on you" creates resentment, not commitment. Candidates who accept under pressure leave within 6 months.

**Don't trash their other options:** "That other company has terrible culture" makes you look insecure and unprofessional. Trust candidates to make their own comparisons.

**Don't go completely dark:** If a candidate asks for time to think, don't disappear for a week. Check in every 2-3 days with value-adds (relevant article, team achievement, helpful resource) to stay top of mind without being annoying.

**Don't make promises you can't keep:** "You'll definitely get promoted in 12 months" or "we're going to IPO next year" will come back to bite you. Candidates remember these promises and leave when they don't materialize.

## The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything

The best closers don't think of themselves as convincing candidates to accept. They think of themselves as helping candidates make the right decision for their career—even if that decision is to decline.

This sounds counterintuitive, but it works. When you genuinely care about the candidate's success rather than just filling the role, it shows. Candidates feel the difference between "I need to hit my hiring goal" and "I truly believe this is a great opportunity for you."

Sometimes the candidate's concerns are legitimate deal-breakers, and the right move is to acknowledge that rather than overselling. [Data from Jobvite](https://www.jobvite.com) shows that recruiters who are honest about fit issues—even when it means losing a candidate—build long-term relationships that lead to referrals, boomerang hires, and stronger employer brand.

## Putting It All Together

When you've got a fence-sitter:

1. **First, diagnose:** Have the "What would make this a hell yes?" conversation to understand real objections.

2. **Then, create urgency:** Use the deadline + sweetener approach if you have legitimate timeline pressure and can offer something valuable.

3. **Finally, reduce anxiety:** Connect them with a peer who can provide authentic insight and emotional reassurance.

This combination addresses the rational concerns (compensation, career path), creates momentum (urgency), and handles the emotional hesitation (fear of unknown) that keeps candidates stuck.

You won't close everyone—sometimes candidates have better offers or legitimate reasons to decline. But these tactics will significantly improve your close rate on candidates who are genuinely considering your offer but need help getting off the fence.

And remember: the best close happens way before the offer stage. If you've built a strong relationship throughout the interview process, addressed concerns proactively, and set clear expectations, you won't have nearly as many fence-sitters in the first place.

But when you do? Use these tactics. They work.
