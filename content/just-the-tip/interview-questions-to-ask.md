Listen up: [The questions YOU ask in an interview are just as important as how you answer theirs](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-questions-interview-importance). When you say "No, I don't have any questions," you're telling them you either didn't prepare or don't actually care about the role.

Neither is a good look.

Here are the questions you should be asking in every interview. Print this out. Memorize it. [These questions will tell you more about the company than any polished pitch from HR](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/questions-reveal-company-culture).

## Questions That Reveal Red Flags

**"Why is this position open?"**

[This tells you everything](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/why-position-open-interview-question). Is it new headcount (growth, good sign)? Did someone get promoted (internal mobility, also good)? Or did the last three people quit within 6 months (run)?

[Listen for hesitation or vague answers](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/interview-answer-hesitation-red-flags). If they can't give you a straight answer about why this role exists, that's your sign.

**"What happened to the last person in this role?"**

Same question, different angle. [If they left for a "better opportunity" after 8 months, that's code for "this job sucks"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/short-tenure-predecessor-red-flag).

[Multiple people leaving the same role quickly is a massive red flag](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-retention/revolving-door-position-warning). The problem is the role or the manager, not the employees.

**"What's the biggest challenge someone in this role would face in the first 90 days?"**

[This shows you what they're actually worried about](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-question-first-90-days-challenges). Are they concerned about reasonable ramp-up stuff, or are they describing an impossible situation with no support?

[If the answer is "hitting the ground running with no training because we're understaffed," you know what you're walking into](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/unrealistic-onboarding-expectations).

## Questions About Growth and Development

**"Can you tell me about someone who started in this role and where they are now?"**

[This reveals if there's actual career progression or if this is a dead-end job](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/career-advancement-opportunities-question).

[If they can't name a single person who's grown from this role, that tells you something](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/internal-mobility-track-record). You'll be stuck here or you'll have to leave to move up.

**"What does success look like in this role after 6 months? After a year?"**

[This shows you if they have clear expectations or if you'll be guessing what "good" looks like](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/role-success-metrics-clarity).

[Vague answers like "contributing to the team" mean they don't actually know what they want from you](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/unclear-success-metrics-problem). That's a recipe for frustration on both sides.

**"What's the professional development budget for this role?"**

[Companies that invest in their people put money behind it](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/professional-development-budget-importance). If they don't have a clear answer or the number is suspiciously low, [they expect you to develop yourself on your own time and dime](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/learning-development-investment).

## Questions About the Team and Manager

**"What's your management style?" (If interviewing with your would-be boss)**

[There's no wrong answer here, but you need to know if their style matches what you need to succeed](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/management-style-compatibility).

[Hands-off manager + someone who needs structure = disaster. Micromanager + someone who needs autonomy = also disaster](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/management-style-fit-importance).

**"How does the team handle disagreements or conflicting priorities?"**

[This tells you if conflict is dealt with directly or swept under the rug](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/conflict-resolution-culture-assessment).

[If the answer is "we don't really have disagreements," that's either a lie or a sign that nobody feels safe speaking up](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/healthy-conflict-culture). Both are bad.

**"What's the team's biggest strength and biggest opportunity for improvement?"**

[Watch if they can honestly name an improvement area](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/self-awareness-team-assessment). [If everything is perfect and there's nothing to improve, they're either delusional or lying](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/interview-honesty-assessment).

## Questions About Work-Life Balance (That Aren't Obvious)

**"What time do people typically start and end their day?"**

[Way better than asking "is there work-life balance?" because you get actual data](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/work-hours-culture-question).

[If the answer is "Oh, people are pretty flexible" but then they mention 7 AM meetings and evening Slack messages, you have your answer](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/work-life-balance-reality-vs-policy).

**"When was the last time someone on the team took a week-long vacation?"**

[This reveals if people actually use their PTO or if it's "unlimited" in theory but impossible in practice](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/unlimited-pto-utilization-reality).

[Uncomfortable silence or "um, I'm not sure..." means nobody takes time off](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/pto-usage-culture).

**"How does the company handle after-hours or weekend work?"**

[Is it rare emergencies only, or is it expected regularly?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/after-hours-work-expectations) [Do you get comp time? Or is it just "part of the job"?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/overtime-expectations-transparency)

[Better to know now than be surprised when you're expected to work every Saturday](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/weekend-work-culture-assessment).

## The Money Question (That's Not About Money)

**"What would make someone wildly successful in this role?"**

[This is sneaky good because it gets them to tell you exactly what they value](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/success-criteria-interview-question). Then you can decide if that aligns with what you're good at and want to do.

[If they say "someone who can juggle competing priorities without complaining" that's code for "you'll be overwhelmed and we won't fix it"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/job-requirements-decoded).

## What Not to Ask

**"What does your company do?"** [Google exists. Don't ask things you should already know](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-questions-basic-research).

**"What's the salary?"** [That's a separate conversation. Ask during the offer stage, not during early interviews](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/salary-question-timing).

**"Can I work from home?"** [Phrase it better: "What's the remote work policy?" or "How does the team handle flexibility?"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/remote-work-policy-question-framing)

## The Bottom Line

[Your questions show you're thoughtful, engaged, and evaluating if this is the right fit for YOU](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-questions-demonstrate-engagement). [Not just desperately hoping they'll hire you](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/interview-as-two-way-evaluation).

[Good companies respect candidates who ask tough questions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/quality-questions-positive-signal). Bad companies get defensive. [That reaction alone tells you everything you need to know](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/defensive-response-red-flag).

Ask the questions. Take notes on their answers. And when they hesitate, deflect, or give you corporate BS instead of straight answers? [That's data. Use it](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-answer-analysis).

Your future self will thank you for dodging that bullet.
