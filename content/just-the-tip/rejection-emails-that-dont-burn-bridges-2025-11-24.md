Rejection is part of the job. But how you reject candidates determines whether they become future hires or Glassdoor revenge reviewers.

The goal? Make them disappointed they didn't get THIS role, but excited to try again for the NEXT one.

Let's talk about rejection that doesn't burn bridges.

## The Anatomy of a Good Rejection

**What bad rejections do:**
- Generic "we've decided to move forward with other candidates"
- No timeline (they've been waiting three weeks)
- Zero personalization
- Feels like a form letter (because it is)

**What good rejections do:**
- Acknowledge them specifically
- Provide closure quickly
- Leave the door open
- Make them feel respected

## Templates That Actually Work

**For early-stage candidates:**

"Hi [Name], thank you for your interest in the [Role] position. After careful review, we're moving forward with candidates whose experience more closely aligns with our current needs. I was genuinely impressed by [specific thing], and I'd encourage you to apply for future roles that match your background. I'll keep your resume on file."

**For candidates who interviewed:**

"Hi [Name], I wanted to personally let you know we've decided to move forward with another candidate for the [Role] position. This was a difficult decision—your [specific strength] really stood out to our team. The market for talent like yours is strong, and I don't think you'll be searching for long. If another role opens up that's a better fit, I'd love to reconnect."

## The Secret Sauce

One line makes all the difference: mention something specific about THEM.

"Your background in fintech" or "your approach to stakeholder management" or "your enthusiasm during the panel interview."

This tiny personalization transforms a form letter into a human interaction.

## The Bottom Line

Every rejection is a chance to build your employer brand or destroy it.

The candidate you reject today might be the perfect fit for tomorrow's role. Or they might become a hiring manager at a future client. Or they might just tell everyone they know what kind of recruiter you are.

Reject with respect. Close the loop quickly. Leave the door cracked open.

A good rejection is basically just a breakup done right—honest, kind, and leaving room for "maybe someday."
