# BambooHR Recruiting Module Review: Great HRIS, Mediocre ATS

Let's be clear from the start: **BambooHR is an excellent HRIS platform**. It handles employee data, time off, performance reviews, and onboarding beautifully. But when it comes to recruiting? It's... fine. Not great, not terrible, just fine.

User reviews on [G2 give BambooHR's recruiting features 4.3 out of 5 stars](https://www.g2.com/products/bamboohr/reviews), but when you read the actual reviews, there's a pattern: people love the HRIS, tolerate the recruiting module.

## What BambooHR Recruiting Actually Offers

BambooHR's recruiting module (technically called "Applicant Tracking System" but it's really just a bolt-on to their HRIS) provides basic applicant tracking functionality.

According to [BambooHR's product page](https://www.bamboohr.com/applicant-tracking/), you get:

- **Job posting and distribution** to major job boards
- **Candidate pipeline management** with basic kanban view
- **Interview scheduling** (manual coordination, not automated)
- **Offer letter generation** that syncs with HRIS for onboarding
- **Basic hiring analytics** showing time-to-fill and source effectiveness

The killer feature? **Seamless transition from candidate to employee**. When you hire someone in BambooHR, their candidate profile automatically becomes their employee profile. No data re-entry, no duplicate records, no integration headaches.

"That's why we use it," admits a recruiting leader in a [Capterra review](https://www.capterra.com/). "Not because the recruiting features are amazing, but because the handoff to HRIS is frictionless."

## What Works Well

User reviews on [TrustRadius](https://www.trustradius.com/) and [G2](https://www.g2.com/) highlight several strengths:

**Simplicity:**
BambooHR recruiting isn't trying to be enterprise-grade. It's straightforward, clean, and easy to use.

"I set it up in an afternoon without any training," reports one HR generalist on [Software Advice](https://www.softwareadvice.com/). "For small companies that don't have dedicated recruiting teams, that simplicity is valuable."

**Job Board Integration:**
BambooHR posts to [Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and other major boards](https://www.bamboohr.com/) with one click. Not revolutionary, but it works.

**Candidate Communication:**
Email templates, automated responses, and status updates are solid. According to [user reviews on Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/), the email system is "better than most ATS platforms, actually."

**Mobile App:**
BambooHR's mobile app lets hiring managers review candidates, leave feedback, and advance candidates from their phone. [Reviews on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/) give it 4.7 stars for usability.

**Reporting:**
While not as deep as dedicated ATS platforms, BambooHR provides useful reports on:
- Source effectiveness (which job boards produce hires)
- Time-to-fill by role and department
- Pipeline conversion rates
- EEO/diversity tracking

## What Doesn't Work Well

Here's where BambooHR recruiting falls short compared to dedicated ATS platforms:

**Limited Sourcing Capabilities:**
BambooHR has **no built-in sourcing tools**. You can't search LinkedIn, build talent pools, or do anything beyond managing applicants who apply to your jobs.

"It's applicant tracking, not talent acquisition," explains a recruiting manager in a [G2 review](https://www.g2.com/). "If you're actively sourcing passive candidates, you need another tool."

**Basic Interview Management:**
Interview scheduling is manual. There's no automated scheduling, no calendar optimization, no panel coordination. You're back to email ping-pong to find time slots.

Multiple reviews on [TrustRadius](https://www.trustradius.com/) mention this as the biggest pain point: "Why do I have a recruiting system that can't schedule interviews automatically? It's 2025."

**No Advanced Analytics:**
Compared to platforms like Ashby or Greenhouse, BambooHR's recruiting analytics are basic. You get high-level funnel metrics, but nothing about interviewer performance, candidate quality scores, or pipeline velocity.

**Limited Customization:**
The candidate pipeline stages are fixed. You can rename them, but you can't add complex workflows, conditional logic, or automated actions based on candidate status.

A recruiting operations specialist on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/) notes: "BambooHR recruiting works great if your process is simple and linear. If you have complex approval chains or unique workflows, you'll fight the system constantly."

**Chrome Extension Limitations:**
BambooHR has a Chrome extension for adding candidates from LinkedIn, but user reviews on [G2](https://www.g2.com/) say it's "clunky" and "crashes frequently." Compared to tools like SeekOut or LinkedIn Recruiter, it's a significant downgrade.

## Integration Ecosystem

Here's an interesting dynamic: BambooHR integrates well with other tools, which some teams use to compensate for its recruiting limitations.

According to [BambooHR's integration marketplace](https://www.bamboohr.com/marketplace/):

- **Assessment tools:** Criteria Corp, Wonderlic, HackerRank
- **Background checks:** Checkr, Sterling, GoodHire
- **Video interviewing:** Spark Hire, myInterview
- **Skills testing:** TestGorilla, Codility

"We use BambooHR for the core ATS and integrate with better tools for everything else," explains a talent acquisition director on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). "It's more work to manage multiple platforms, but we get best-in-class functionality where it matters."

## Pricing: The Hidden Gotcha

BambooHR doesn't publish pricing publicly, but [user discussions on Quora](https://www.quora.com/) and [PeerSpot](https://www.peerspot.com/) reveal some patterns:

**HRIS pricing:**
- Typically **$6-$8 per employee per month** for core HRIS features
- Minimum commitments around **$3,000-$5,000 annually** for small companies

**Recruiting add-on:**
- Usually **$3-$5 per employee per month additional**
- May be included free for companies over 75 employees

For a 50-person company: **$5,400-$7,800 annually** for HRIS + recruiting.

That's competitive with other HRIS platforms, but **2-3x more expensive** than standalone ATS options like Greenhouse or Lever for recruiting-only functionality.

## The Real Question: Buy or Build?

The decision isn't really "Should we use BambooHR recruiting?"

The real question is: **"If we already use BambooHR HRIS, should we add the recruiting module or buy a separate ATS?"**

[User sentiment on G2](https://www.g2.com/) suggests:

**Stick with BambooHR recruiting if:**
- You're a **small company** (under 100 employees) with simple hiring needs
- You hire **fewer than 50 people per year**
- You don't have dedicated recruiting staff
- **HR generalists handle recruiting** along with other responsibilities
- You value simplicity and unified data over advanced features

**Get a separate ATS if:**
- You're hiring **100+ people per year**
- You have **dedicated recruiters** who need advanced tools
- You do active **sourcing of passive candidates**
- You run **complex interview processes** with panels and multiple rounds
- You care about **deep recruiting analytics** and optimization

## The Verdict

I'm giving BambooHR recruiting **3.8 out of 5 stars**.

It's a convenient, simple recruiting module that works well for small companies that already use BambooHR HRIS and don't have complex hiring needs. The seamless candidate-to-employee transition is genuinely valuable.

But if you're a serious recruiting organization doing high-volume hiring, you'll quickly outgrow it and need a dedicated ATS. Don't let the HRIS integration convenience trap you in a recruiting tool that limits your effectiveness.

**The bottom line:** BambooHR recruiting is great for companies where HR does recruiting as a side job. It's not built for companies where recruiting is the job.

Choose accordingly.
