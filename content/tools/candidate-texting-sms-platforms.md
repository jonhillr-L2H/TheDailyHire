Candidates don't answer phone calls. [78% of phone calls from unknown numbers go to voicemail](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-phone-call-response-rates-2025).

Candidates sometimes respond to emails. [Average email response rate for recruiter outreach: 15-20%](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiter-email-response-rates/).

But candidates DO respond to text messages. [Text message response rates: 45-60%](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/candidate-texting-response-rates-2025).

[SMS recruiting platforms let you text candidates at scale—for interview reminders, quick updates, and engagement during the hiring process](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/sms-recruiting-platforms-2025).

Here's which texting platforms work best, when to use them, and when texting crosses the line into creepy territory.

## What Candidate Texting Platforms Actually Do

[These aren't just "send a text message" tools](https://www.lever.co/blog/sms-recruiting-features/)—they're recruiting communication platforms optimized for SMS:

**Two-way conversations**: [Candidates can text back, creating actual conversations (not one-way blasts)](https://www.textrecruit.com/features/two-way-messaging).

**Automated campaigns**: [Send scheduled texts for interview reminders, application confirmations, and status updates](https://www.fountain.com/features/automated-texting).

**Bulk messaging**: [Text multiple candidates at once with personalized variables](https://www.grayscale.com/features/bulk-sms).

**Compliance**: [TCPA-compliant opt-in/opt-out, message logging, and consent tracking](https://www.textrecruit.com/compliance).

**ATS integration**: [Connect to your ATS so texts sync with candidate records](https://www.fountain.com/integrations).

**Analytics**: [Track delivery rates, response rates, and engagement](https://www.grayscale.com/features/analytics).

[If you're doing high-volume hiring or need faster candidate communication, texting platforms can significantly improve engagement](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/sms-recruiting-effectiveness-2025).

## TextRecruit: The Recruiting-Specific SMS Leader

[TextRecruit is built specifically for recruiting and talent acquisition teams](https://www.textrecruit.com/).

**Pricing:** Custom pricing starting around $500-$1,000/month depending on message volume.

**What it does well:**

**Recruiting-focused features**: [Pre-built templates for common recruiting scenarios](https://www.textrecruit.com/templates)—interview reminders, application confirmations, offer follow-ups.

**Two-way conversations**: [Candidates can reply to texts and have actual conversations with recruiters](https://www.textrecruit.com/features/two-way-messaging). Not just one-way blasts.

**ATS integrations**: [Connects with Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS, Workday, and other major ATS platforms](https://www.textrecruit.com/integrations). Texts sync with candidate records automatically.

**Compliance built-in**: [TCPA-compliant opt-in/opt-out workflows](https://www.textrecruit.com/compliance), consent tracking, and automatic opt-out handling.

**Chatbot capabilities**: [AI-powered chatbot can answer common candidate questions via text](https://www.textrecruit.com/features/ai-chatbot).

**Analytics**: [Track open rates, response rates, and conversion metrics by campaign](https://www.textrecruit.com/features/analytics).

**What to consider:**

**Pricing isn't transparent**: [Custom pricing requires sales conversations](https://www.g2.com/products/textrecruit/pricing), which some companies find frustrating.

**Learning curve for advanced features**: [While basic texting is simple, chatbot setup and campaign automation require training](https://www.capterra.com/p/181674/TextRecruit/reviews).

**Message volume limits**: [Pricing tiers based on message volume](https://www.trustradius.com/products/textrecruit/reviews)—high-volume texting gets expensive.

**Best for:** Recruiting teams (10+ recruiters) at companies hiring 100+ people annually who need recruiting-specific SMS with ATS integration.

**Skip if:** You're a small company with low hiring volume, or you only need basic texting without advanced automation.

## Fountain: The High-Volume Hourly Hiring Platform

[Fountain combines SMS recruiting with applicant tracking for high-volume, hourly hiring](https://www.fountain.com/).

**Pricing:** Custom pricing. Typically $300-$800/month depending on hiring volume.

**What it does well:**

**High-volume hiring focus**: [Built for companies hiring hundreds of hourly workers monthly](https://www.fountain.com/solutions/high-volume-hiring)—retail, hospitality, warehousing, gig economy.

**SMS + ATS in one platform**: [You don't need separate ATS and texting tools](https://www.fountain.com/platform). Fountain handles both.

**Mobile-first candidate experience**: [Candidates can apply, schedule interviews, and complete onboarding entirely via text](https://www.fountain.com/features/mobile-apply).

**Automated workflows**: [Text candidates automatically at each hiring stage](https://www.fountain.com/features/automated-workflows)—application received, interview scheduled, offer extended.

**Background checks integrated**: [Trigger background checks via text](https://www.fountain.com/features/background-checks), candidates complete on mobile.

**Multilingual support**: [Supports texting in multiple languages](https://www.fountain.com/features/multilingual)—critical for diverse hourly workforces.

**What to consider:**

**Designed for high-volume hourly hiring**: [If you're hiring salaried professionals, Fountain's features may not align](https://www.g2.com/products/fountain/reviews). It's optimized for speed and scale, not nuanced professional recruiting.

**ATS features are basic**: [Fountain's ATS is functional but not as feature-rich as Greenhouse or Lever](https://www.capterra.com/p/174938/Fountain/reviews). Trade-off for integrated SMS.

**Pricing scales with volume**: [The more you hire, the more you pay](https://www.trustradius.com/products/fountain/reviews). Can get expensive for very high-volume operations.

**Best for:** Companies hiring 50+ hourly workers monthly (retail, hospitality, logistics, gig economy) who need SMS + ATS in one platform.

**Skip if:** You're hiring salaried professionals, need advanced ATS features, or have low hiring volume.

## Grayscale: The Affordable SMS Recruiting Tool

[Grayscale offers SMS recruiting features at lower price points than TextRecruit or Fountain](https://www.grayscale.com/).

**Pricing:** Starts at $99/month for small teams. Scales to $500-$1,000/month for larger operations.

**What it does well:**

**Affordable**: [Significantly cheaper than TextRecruit for basic SMS recruiting](https://www.grayscale.com/pricing). Accessible for small and mid-size companies.

**Easy to use**: [Simple interface, minimal learning curve](https://www.g2.com/products/grayscale/reviews). Most recruiters are texting candidates within an hour of setup.

**Bulk texting with personalization**: [Send the same message to multiple candidates with personalized fields (first name, role, interview time)](https://www.grayscale.com/features/bulk-sms).

**Two-way conversations**: [Candidates can reply and have conversations](https://www.grayscale.com/features/conversations), though not as sophisticated as TextRecruit's chat features.

**Basic ATS integration**: [Works with major ATS platforms](https://www.grayscale.com/integrations), though integration is less seamless than TextRecruit.

**Compliance tools**: [TCPA opt-in/opt-out, consent tracking, message logging](https://www.grayscale.com/compliance).

**What to consider:**

**Fewer advanced features**: [No AI chatbot, limited automation, basic analytics](https://www.capterra.com/p/209845/Grayscale/reviews) compared to TextRecruit.

**Smaller customer base**: [Less established than TextRecruit or Fountain](https://www.trustradius.com/products/grayscale/reviews), which may affect long-term product development.

**Integration quality varies**: [Some users report ATS integrations aren't as reliable as dedicated platforms](https://www.g2.com/products/grayscale/reviews).

**Best for:** Small to mid-size companies (10-200 employees) who want affordable SMS recruiting without advanced automation.

**Skip if:** You need sophisticated chatbots, advanced automation, or enterprise-grade ATS integration.

## JazzHR (Built-In SMS Feature): The ATS With Texting Included

[JazzHR, a small business ATS, includes SMS recruiting as a built-in feature](https://www.jazzhr.com/).

**Pricing:** JazzHR starts at $75/month. SMS included in mid-tier plans ($359/month).

**What it does well:**

**No additional tool needed**: [If you're already using JazzHR, texting is built-in](https://www.jazzhr.com/features/texting). No separate platform or integration required.

**Simple candidate texting**: [Send interview reminders, updates, and quick messages directly from your ATS](https://www.jazzhr.com/features/sms-recruiting).

**Affordable**: [Included in your ATS subscription](https://www.jazzhr.com/pricing)—no additional per-message fees like standalone platforms.

**Compliance handled**: [TCPA opt-in/opt-out managed within JazzHR](https://www.jazzhr.com/compliance).

**What to consider:**

**Basic SMS features**: [JazzHR's texting is functional but not as feature-rich as dedicated SMS platforms](https://www.g2.com/products/jazzhr/reviews). No chatbots, limited automation.

**Only works if you use JazzHR**: [If you're using a different ATS, this isn't an option](https://www.capterra.com/p/132017/JazzHR/reviews).

**Message volume limits**: [Some pricing tiers have message caps](https://www.trustradius.com/products/jazzhr/reviews). High-volume texting may require upgrades.

**Best for:** Small businesses already using JazzHR who want basic SMS recruiting without paying for a separate tool.

**Skip if:** You need advanced SMS features, use a different ATS, or do high-volume texting.

## When To Text Candidates (And When NOT To)

[SMS recruiting works—but only when used appropriately](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-texting-best-practices-2025).

**Good uses of candidate texting:**

✅ **Interview reminders**: "Hi [Name], reminder that your interview with [Company] is tomorrow at 2 PM. Reply YES to confirm or NO to reschedule."

✅ **Quick updates**: "Your application for [Role] has been received. We'll review it and get back to you within 5 business days."

✅ **Scheduling**: "Are you available for a phone interview Tuesday at 3 PM or Wednesday at 11 AM?"

✅ **Urgent communication**: "We need to reschedule your interview due to an emergency. Can you do Thursday instead of Wednesday?"

✅ **Event invitations**: "We're hosting a hiring event on [Date]. Interested? Reply YES for details."

**Bad uses of candidate texting:**

❌ **Cold outreach**: Texting candidates who didn't apply feels invasive. Use LinkedIn or email for initial outreach.

❌ **Long messages**: Texts should be brief. Don't send paragraphs via SMS.

❌ **Outside business hours**: Texting at 9 PM or on weekends is unprofessional.

❌ **Without consent**: ALWAYS get opt-in before texting. [TCPA violations carry fines of $500-$1,500 per text](https://www.fcc.gov/general/telemarketing-and-robocalls).

❌ **For sensitive information**: Don't text offer details, salary info, or rejection news. Use email or phone.

[Text messages should be transactional and timely, not promotional or intrusive](https://www.lever.co/blog/candidate-texting-dos-and-donts/).

## Compliance: Don't Get Sued For Texting Candidates

[Texting candidates is regulated by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)](https://www.fcc.gov/general/telemarketing-and-robocalls).

**Key compliance requirements:**

**1. Get explicit consent**

[You cannot text candidates without their permission](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/tcpa-compliance-recruiting-texts). Consent must be:
- Clear and conspicuous
- Separate from other agreements
- Specific to receiving recruiting texts

**Good consent:** "By checking this box, you agree to receive text messages from [Company] regarding your job application. Reply STOP to opt-out."

**Bad consent:** Buried in terms and conditions or assumed from submitting an application.

**2. Provide opt-out**

[Every text must include a way to opt-out](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/text-message-spam). Standard: "Reply STOP to unsubscribe."

**3. Honor opt-outs immediately**

[Once someone opts out, you cannot text them again](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business). No "one last message."

**4. Keep records**

[Document consent, message content, opt-outs, and delivery](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/sms-recruiting-compliance-documentation). If someone claims they didn't consent, you need proof.

[All reputable SMS recruiting platforms handle TCPA compliance](https://www.textrecruit.com/compliance), but verify before choosing a tool.

## How To Choose The Right SMS Recruiting Platform

**For recruiting teams with budget:** **TextRecruit** (most features, best ATS integration)

**For high-volume hourly hiring:** **Fountain** (SMS + ATS optimized for speed and scale)

**For affordable basic SMS:** **Grayscale** (simple, cheap, functional)

**For small businesses using JazzHR:** **JazzHR built-in SMS** (included in subscription)

**For companies not ready for SMS yet:** Use email and phone—texting isn't mandatory

## The Bottom Line

[Candidate texting gets responses—but it must be used appropriately](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/candidate-texting-best-practices-2025).

**Text for:**
- Interview reminders
- Quick updates
- Scheduling
- Urgent communication

**Don't text for:**
- Cold outreach
- Sensitive information
- Late-night messages
- Promotional content

[Choose a platform based on your hiring volume, budget, and whether you need advanced features like chatbots and automation](https://www.lever.co/blog/sms-recruiting-platform-selection/).

And always, ALWAYS get consent before texting candidates. [TCPA violations are expensive and damage your employer brand](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/tcpa-violation-costs-2025).
