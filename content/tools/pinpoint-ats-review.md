Finally, an ATS that doesn't feel like it was designed by people who've never recruited a day in their lives. Pinpoint is modern, customizable, and shockingly intuitive. It's almost like they talked to actual recruiters before building this thing.

## What It Actually Does

Pinpoint is a full-featured ATS that handles everything from job posting to offer management. The interface is clean, the workflows make sense, and - here's the kicker - it actually loads fast. Remember how Greenhouse takes 47 seconds to load a candidate profile? Yeah, Pinpoint doesn't do that.

The customization is where it shines. You can configure hiring stages, build custom workflows, create interview scorecards that don't suck, and generally make the system work how YOUR team works instead of forcing your team to work how the system wants. User reviews on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/pinpoint-pinpoint/reviews) and [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/182974/Pinpoint/) consistently praise this flexibility - one reviewer said "finally an ATS that adapts to us instead of making us adapt to it."

The candidate experience is solid. Career sites don't look like they're from 2007, application forms are mobile-friendly, and candidates can actually track their progress without having to create an account with a blood sample and their first-born child.

## The Good Stuff

Integration game is strong. Connects with LinkedIn, job boards, background check providers, and most of the tools you're already using. The API is well-documented if you need custom integrations, and reports indicate the support team doesn't ghost you when you need help.

Reporting is actually useful instead of just pretty. You can build custom reports, track real metrics, and get data without a PhD in SQL. The analytics dashboards show time-to-hire, source effectiveness, pipeline metrics - all the stuff you actually need to know instead of vanity metrics nobody cares about.

Collaboration features are decent. Hiring managers can leave feedback, interviewers can submit scorecards, and everyone can see what's happening without 47 email chains. User reviews on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/182974/Pinpoint/) mention the transparency helps reduce the "so what's the status?" messages that make recruiters want to fake their own deaths.

## The Not-So-Good Stuff

It's not cheap. Pricing isn't published (red flag #1), but reviews suggest it's positioned as a mid-market to enterprise solution. If you're a 10-person startup, this probably isn't for you. If you're a 500-person company tired of your current ATS making you miserable, the price might be worth it.

The mobile app exists but isn't amazing. You can check stuff and move candidates through stages, but you're not going to want to do serious work from your phone. Then again, if you're doing serious recruiting work from your phone, you've got bigger problems than app limitations.

Some [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/pinpoint-pinpoint/reviews) mention the learning curve for admin setup can be steep. The flexibility is great once you've got it configured, but getting there requires time and patience. Not ideal if you need something up and running tomorrow.

## The Verdict

Pinpoint is solid. It's modern, flexible, and doesn't make you want to rage-quit recruiting. If you're currently using an ATS that's older than the iPhone and considering switching, Pinpoint deserves a look.

Is it perfect? No. Is it better than most alternatives? User reviews suggest yes. Will it solve all your recruiting problems? Of course not, because recruiting is hard and software can only do so much.

But if you need an ATS that actually works the way recruiters work, gives you flexibility without being overwhelming, and doesn't feel like it was built in 2012 and never updated, Pinpoint is worth the demo call.

Just be ready for the "contact us for pricing" conversation. They're not going to just tell you how much it costs like normal people.
