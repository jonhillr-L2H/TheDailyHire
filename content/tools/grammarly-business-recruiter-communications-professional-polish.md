Let's be brutally honest: [one typo in a job description or recruiting email can make you look unprofessional and cost you good candidates](https://www.ere.net/typos-recruiting-messages-candidate-perception-impact-2025/).

[A survey by CareerBuilder found that 77% of hiring managers immediately dismiss resumes with typos or grammatical errors](https://www.careerbuilder.com/advice/typos-resume-immediate-rejection). The irony? [Recruiters make just as many mistakes in job postings and outreach emails—and candidates notice](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/job-posting-grammar-mistakes-candidate-perspective/).

[Grammarly Business](https://www.grammarly.com/business) is a writing assistant that catches grammar mistakes, spelling errors, punctuation issues, tone problems, and clarity issues in real-time as you write.

[It works everywhere: Gmail, LinkedIn, ATS platforms, Slack, Word, Google Docs, and pretty much any text field on the internet](https://www.grammarly.com/features). [It costs $15/user/month and can save recruiters hours of proofreading time while making every message more professional](https://www.grammarly.com/business/pricing).

[User reviews rate Grammarly 4.7/5 stars](https://www.g2.com/products/grammarly-business/reviews), with recruiters and HR professionals specifically praising its ability to catch mistakes in high-volume communication scenarios.

Is it perfect? No. But for recruiters who write dozens of emails daily, draft job descriptions, and message candidates constantly, Grammarly is one of those tools that pays for itself immediately.

## What Grammarly Business Actually Does

[Grammarly is an AI-powered writing assistant that analyzes your text and provides suggestions in real-time](https://www.grammarly.com/how-grammarly-works).

**Core features:**

[**Tone detection**: Analyzes your writing tone (formal, casual, confident, friendly, etc.) and suggests adjustments based on context](https://www.grammarly.com/tone-detector).

## What It Costs

[**Grammarly Free**: Basic grammar and spelling corrections, limited suggestions](https://www.grammarly.com/pricing). [Good enough for casual personal use but insufficient for professional recruiting communication](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/free-vs-premium-comparison).

[**Grammarly Premium**: $12/month (annual) or $30/month (monthly). Full grammar checking, clarity suggestions, tone detection, vocabulary enhancement, plagiarism detection, style suggestions](https://www.grammarly.com/pricing). [Good for individual recruiters who want full features](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/premium-plan-features).

[**Grammarly Business**: $15/user/month (annual billing, 3-149 users). Everything in Premium plus brand tone, style guide, analytics dashboard, centralized billing, account roles and permissions](https://www.grammarly.com/business/pricing).

[At $15/month, you're paying $3/hour for time savings](https://www.grammarly.com/business/roi-calculator). [Plus avoiding embarrassing mistakes that hurt candidate experience](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-communication-quality-candidate-perception-2025/).

## What Grammarly Does Well

## What Grammarly Doesn't Do Well

**Not perfect—false positives happen**: [Grammarly sometimes flags correct sentences or suggests changes that don't improve clarity](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/grammarly-business-limitations-2025). [User reviews note you can't blindly accept every suggestion—you need to evaluate recommendations](https://www.capterra.com/p/140732/Grammarly-Business/reviews/?filter_topic=false-positives). [It's a tool that assists writing, not replaces human judgment](https://blog.grammarly.com/using-grammarly-suggestions-wisely/).

**Struggles with highly technical or industry-specific language**: [If you're recruiting for niche technical roles and using specialized terminology, Grammarly may flag correct terms as errors](https://community.grammarly.com/t/technical-terminology-false-flags/). [You can add words to your personal dictionary, but this requires ongoing maintenance](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/personal-dictionary-grammarly).

**Tone detection isn't context-aware enough**: [Grammarly might say your message sounds "uncertain" when you're intentionally being polite and non-pushy](https://www.reddit.com/r/grammarly/comments/tone_detection_limitations/). [It's a useful signal but not gospel](https://blog.grammarly.com/tone-detection-limitations-awareness/).

**Plagiarism detection has limits**: [Grammarly's plagiarism checker works for obvious copy-paste scenarios but won't catch paraphrased or heavily edited borrowed content](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/plagiarism-detection-limitations). [It's not as robust as dedicated plagiarism tools like Turnitin](https://www.pcmag.com/news/grammarly-vs-turnitin-plagiarism-detection-comparison).

**Browser extension can slow down some websites**: [User reviews occasionally report the Grammarly browser extension causing lag on complex web pages](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/grammarly.com?languages=en&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3). [You can disable Grammarly on specific sites if needed](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/disable-grammarly-specific-sites).

## Who Should Use Grammarly Business

**Recruiting teams (3+ recruiters)**: [If you have multiple recruiters writing job descriptions, candidate emails, and InMails, Grammarly Business ensures consistent quality and tone across the team](https://www.grammarly.com/business/use-cases/recruiting). [Brand tone and style guide features are particularly valuable for team standardization](https://www.ere.net/grammarly-business-recruiting-team-benefits-2025/).

**Solo recruiters or small teams who write a lot**: [If you're sending 20-50 emails per day, drafting multiple job descriptions per week, and messaging candidates constantly, Grammarly Premium or Business saves proofreading time and catches embarrassing mistakes](https://blog.grammarly.com/recruiter-writing-volume-grammarly-value/).

**Recruiters who aren't naturally strong writers**: [If writing isn't your strength but communication is critical to your job, Grammarly helps you sound professional and polished](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/grammarly-recruiting-writing-support-2025). [User reviews from non-native English speakers especially praise Grammarly for improving their professional communication](https://www.g2.com/products/grammarly-business/reviews?filters%5Bdemographic%5D=non-native-english-speakers).

**Recruiting agencies and firms with client-facing communication**: [If you're writing emails on behalf of clients or presenting candidates to external stakeholders, Grammarly ensures your communication reflects well on your firm](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-agency-communication-quality-grammarly/).

**Companies concerned with employer brand and candidate experience**: [Typo-filled job descriptions and sloppy recruiting emails hurt your employer brand](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/employer-brand-recruiting-communication-quality/). [Grammarly is a low-cost way to maintain professionalism in all candidate touchpoints](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/employer-brand-communication-quality-tools-2025).

## Who Doesn't Need Grammarly Business

**Recruiters who already have excellent writing skills and low communication volume**: [If you naturally write clearly, rarely make mistakes, and only send a handful of emails per day, Grammarly might be overkill](https://www.ere.net/when-recruiters-dont-need-grammarly/).

**Teams with dedicated recruiting coordinators who proofread communications**: [If someone else reviews and edits recruiting communications before they go out, Grammarly might be redundant](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-communication-workflow-proofreading-process/).

**Very small operations on extremely tight budgets**: [If you're a solo recruiter making 5-10 placements per year and every dollar matters, Grammarly Free might be sufficient](https://www.grammarly.com/pricing). [You can also use free alternatives like LanguageTool or Microsoft Editor, though they're less feature-rich](https://www.pcmag.com/news/free-grammar-checker-alternatives-grammarly-2025).

## The Bottom Line

[Grammarly Business costs $15/user/month and helps recruiters write error-free, professional, clear communications across all platforms](https://www.grammarly.com/business/pricing).

[User reviews rate it 4.7/5 stars, with recruiters specifically praising grammar checking, tone detection, and seamless integrations](https://www.g2.com/products/grammarly-business/reviews).
