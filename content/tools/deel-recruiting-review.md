Deel built its reputation on global payroll and compliance—helping companies hire employees and contractors in 150+ countries without setting up local entities.

In 2024-2025, Deel added recruiting features to create an end-to-end solution: post a job, hire someone in Portugal, onboard them, and pay them—all in one platform.

The global hiring integration is seamless. The problem: the actual ATS (applicant tracking system) functionality is basic compared to dedicated recruiting platforms like Greenhouse, Lever, or Ashby.

Here's when Deel recruiting makes sense, and when you should stick with a dedicated ATS.

## What Deel Recruiting Does

Deel's recruiting product includes:

### 1. Job Posting and Distribution

Post jobs to Deel's own job board and distribute to external sites (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.).

### 2. Application Management

Track candidates through stages: Applied → Screening → Interview → Offer → Hired.

Basic kanban-style pipeline with drag-and-drop functionality.

### 3. Collaborative Hiring

Hiring managers and team members can leave feedback, score candidates, and participate in hiring decisions.

### 4. Global Compliance Integration

The big differentiator: Deel automatically flags compliance considerations for international hires.

If you're hiring in Germany, Deel surfaces:
- Required employment contracts
- Local labor laws
- Tax withholding requirements
- Benefits and leave policies

### 5. Seamless Onboarding and Payroll

Once a candidate accepts an offer, they flow directly into Deel's onboarding and payroll system—no manual data entry, no switching platforms.

## The Pros: Why Companies Use Deel Recruiting

### 1. Unbeatable for Global Hiring

User reviews consistently highlight this as Deel's killer feature:

> "We hired a developer in Brazil. From offer letter to first paycheck, everything was handled in Deel—contracts, compliance, payroll, benefits. We didn't have to set up a Brazilian entity or hire a local accountant."

For companies hiring internationally, Deel's integration eliminates weeks of administrative work.

### 2. One Platform for Recruiting, Onboarding, and Payroll

Instead of juggling Greenhouse (ATS) + Rippling (onboarding) + Remote/Oyster (global payroll), Deel consolidates everything.

User reviews suggest this saves time and reduces errors from manual data transfer between systems.

### 3. Compliance Built-In

Deel automatically generates compliant employment contracts, flags local labor laws, and ensures you're following regulations in 150+ countries.

For non-expert HR teams, this reduces legal risk and administrative burden.

### 4. Expanding to 150+ Countries

Deel supports hiring in more countries than any competitor (Remote, Oyster, Rippling). If you're hiring in less common markets, Deel often has coverage where others don't.

### 5. Contractor and FTE Management in One Place

Unlike traditional ATS platforms, Deel handles both full-time employees and independent contractors—useful for companies with hybrid workforces.

## The Cons: Why Deel's ATS Falls Short

### 1. Basic ATS Features Compared to Dedicated Platforms

User reviews consistently note that Deel's ATS functionality is "bare-bones" compared to Greenhouse, Lever, or Ashby.

Missing or limited features include:
- **Custom interview scorecards**: Limited ability to create structured interview rubrics
- **Advanced analytics**: Basic reporting (time-to-hire, source-of-hire) but no deep funnel analysis
- **Automation**: Minimal workflow automation compared to Greenhouse or Lever
- **Customization**: Limited ability to customize pipelines, stages, and fields
- **Candidate experience**: Basic career site and application flow (not as polished as dedicated ATS platforms)

One user review: "Deel is great for hiring globally, but if you're used to Greenhouse's reporting and customization, Deel feels like a step backward."

### 2. Best for Global Hiring, Not Domestic Recruiting

If you're hiring exclusively in the U.S. or your home country, Deel's recruiting features don't offer much advantage over dedicated ATS platforms.

You're paying for global compliance infrastructure you don't need.

### 3. Integration Limitations

While Deel integrates with some HR tools (Slack, Zoom, Google Workspace), it doesn't integrate as broadly as platforms like Greenhouse (which integrates with 400+ tools).

If your recruiting stack relies on specific integrations (assessment platforms, video interview tools, background check providers), verify Deel supports them before switching.

### 4. Expensive for Small Teams

Deel pricing isn't publicly listed but user reports suggest:
- **Recruiting product**: Bundled with Deel's payroll/compliance platform (can't buy standalone)
- **Total cost**: $500-$1,000+ per employee/contractor per month (varies by country)

For small teams hiring a few people per year, this cost is prohibitive.

### 5. Not Ideal for High-Volume Domestic Hiring

If you're hiring 50+ customer service reps in the U.S., Deel's recruiting product is overkill.

Dedicated ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS) are better suited for high-volume, domestic hiring.

## When Deel Recruiting Makes Sense

Based on user reviews and case studies:

### Global or Remote-First Companies

If you're hiring employees in multiple countries, Deel's recruiting → onboarding → payroll integration is unmatched.

Examples:
- **Remote-first startups**: Hiring across 10+ countries without local HR infrastructure
- **Companies expanding internationally**: First international hires in new markets
- **Distributed teams**: Mix of FTEs and contractors across regions

### Small-to-Mid-Size Companies (<200 employees)

Deel works well for companies that need:
- Basic ATS functionality (not complex workflows)
- Global hiring and payroll in one platform
- Compliance support for international hiring

User reviews suggest Deel is "good enough" for recruiting if your priority is operational simplicity over advanced ATS features.

### Companies Already Using Deel for Payroll

If you're already paying for Deel's global payroll platform, adding recruiting makes sense—you're leveraging infrastructure you've already invested in.

## When Deel Recruiting Doesn't Make Sense

### Domestic-Only Hiring

If you're hiring exclusively in the U.S. (or your home country), Deel's global hiring features don't add value.

Use a dedicated ATS instead:
- **Greenhouse/Lever**: Best-in-class ATS features, extensive integrations
- **Ashby**: Modern ATS with strong analytics
- **JazzHR/Breezy**: Affordable options for small teams

### High-Volume Hiring

For companies hiring 50+ people per quarter, Deel's basic ATS features will feel limiting.

Dedicated platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS) offer better workflow automation, reporting, and candidate experience.

### Companies Requiring Advanced ATS Features

If you need:
- Custom interview scorecards and structured hiring processes
- Deep analytics and funnel reporting
- Extensive integrations with assessment tools, video platforms, and background check providers
- Highly customizable pipelines and workflows

Deel will disappoint. Use Greenhouse, Lever, or Ashby instead.

### Companies Hiring Only Contractors

If you're hiring only independent contractors (not FTEs), Deel's recruiting product is overkill.

Platforms like Upwork, Toptal, or specialized contractor marketplaces are better suited.

## Deel vs. Competitors

**Deel vs. Greenhouse/Lever:**
- **Deel wins**: Global hiring, compliance, payroll integration
- **Greenhouse/Lever wins**: ATS features, analytics, integrations, candidate experience

**Deel vs. Remote/Oyster (Global Payroll Competitors):**
- **Deel wins**: Broader country coverage, recruiting features built-in
- **Remote/Oyster wins**: Slightly better user experience (according to some reviews)

**Deel vs. Rippling:**
- **Deel wins**: More countries supported, better for international contractor management
- **Rippling wins**: Better for U.S.-focused companies, stronger integrations with U.S. benefits providers

## How to Decide: Deel or Dedicated ATS?

Ask yourself:

**1. Are you hiring internationally?**
- **Yes**: Deel makes sense
- **No**: Use a dedicated ATS

**2. Do you need advanced ATS features?**
- **Yes**: Use Greenhouse/Lever + separate global payroll platform (Remote, Oyster, or Deel for payroll only)
- **No**: Deel's basic ATS is probably fine

**3. Are you already using Deel for payroll?**
- **Yes**: Adding recruiting is a no-brainer
- **No**: Evaluate whether you need Deel's global payroll capabilities before committing to the full platform

**4. What's your hiring volume?**
- **Low volume (< 20 hires/year)**: Deel works
- **High volume (50+ hires/year)**: Dedicated ATS is better

## Pricing Considerations

Deel doesn't publish recruiting-specific pricing, but the platform requires:
- **Base platform fee**: Varies by company size
- **Per-employee/contractor fees**: $500-$1,000+/month per person (varies by country and employment type)

For small teams hiring a few international employees per year, this is cost-effective compared to setting up local entities.

For large teams hiring domestically, it's expensive overkill.

## The Bottom Line

**Deel recruiting is purpose-built for global hiring.** If you're hiring employees or contractors in multiple countries, Deel's recruiting → onboarding → payroll integration is unmatched for operational simplicity and compliance.

**But the ATS features are basic.** If you're used to Greenhouse or Lever's advanced workflows, analytics, and customization, Deel will feel limiting.

**When to use Deel recruiting:**
- Global or remote-first companies hiring in multiple countries
- Small-to-mid-size teams (<200 employees) that prioritize operational simplicity
- Companies already using Deel for payroll

**When to skip it:**
- Domestic-only hiring (use Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, or JazzHR)
- High-volume hiring requiring advanced ATS features
- Companies needing deep analytics, custom workflows, and extensive integrations

If you're hiring globally and need "good enough" ATS functionality, Deel is an excellent choice.

If you're hiring domestically or need best-in-class ATS features, stick with a dedicated recruiting platform and use Deel (or Remote/Oyster) only for global payroll.

**Overall Rating**: 8/10 for global hiring, 5/10 for domestic recruiting — Excellent for international teams that value operational simplicity, but ATS features lag behind dedicated platforms.
