# Teamtailor Review: The ATS That Actually Gives a Damn About Your Career Site

Most ATS platforms treat your career site like an afterthought - a generic page that screams "we bought the cheapest package." Teamtailor went the opposite direction and built an entire ATS around the idea that your careers page should actually help you recruit instead of repelling candidates. Revolutionary concept, I know.

## What It Actually Does

Teamtailor is a Swedish ATS that's really three products in one: applicant tracking system, career site builder, and employer branding platform. According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/teamtailor/reviews), it's scoring 4.6/5 stars with most praise going to the "actually attractive" career pages it generates.

The core pitch is simple: Instead of candidates applying through a form that looks like a DMV website, Teamtailor creates branded, mobile-optimized career pages that don't make people want to close the tab immediately. You get customizable templates, built-in analytics on which jobs get the most views, and the ability to create department-specific landing pages without needing a developer.

The ATS functionality is solid but not groundbreaking - candidate pipeline management, collaborative hiring workflows, interview scheduling, email templates. What separates it is the integration between your employer brand and the hiring process. [Capterra reviewers](https://www.capterra.com/p/159085/Teamtailor/) consistently mention this as the main differentiator versus traditional ATS options.

## The Brutally Honest Take

Here's what they don't tell you in the marketing materials: Teamtailor is fantastic if you're a mid-sized company (50-500 employees) that cares about employer branding and has okay-to-high recruiting volume. It's overkill if you're hiring three people a year, and it lacks enterprise features if you're managing thousands of reqs across multiple countries.

The career site builder is legitimately good - way better than the garbage most ATS platforms generate. But "good" is relative. You're not going to win design awards, you're just going to have a careers page that doesn't look actively hostile. For most companies, that's still a massive upgrade.

User reviews on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/teamtailor/reviews) complain about two main things: 1) The reporting isn't as deep as enterprise ATS options like Greenhouse or Lever, and 2) Integrations with HRIS systems can be clunky. Fair criticisms. This isn't built for HR teams that need 47 custom reports. It's built for recruiters who want candidates to actually apply.

## Pricing and The Catch

Teamtailor doesn't list pricing publicly (red flag for transparency), but [reported pricing on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/teamtailor/pricing) puts it around $8,000-$15,000 per year depending on employee count and feature package. Not cheap, but in line with other mid-market ATS options.

The catch is implementation. This isn't a "sign up and go" tool. You'll need to invest time in building out your career site, setting up workflows, and training your team. [Capterra reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/159085/Teamtailor/) mention 2-4 week implementation timelines being common. If you don't have someone dedicated to owning this, it'll become shelfware fast.

## Should You Actually Buy It?

Buy Teamtailor if: Your career page currently sucks, you care about employer branding, you're hiring 50+ people a year, and you have someone who'll actually use the career site builder features.

Skip it if: You need enterprise-level reporting, you're only hiring a handful of people annually, you already have a great career site (congratulations), or you need deep HRIS integration for compliance reasons.

The real competition is Greenhouse and Lever for mid-market, or BambooHR and Workable for smaller teams. Teamtailor sits in an interesting middle ground - more employer brand-focused than traditional ATS, but less robust than enterprise options. For companies where recruiting IS your competitive advantage, that focus makes sense. For everyone else, it's a nice-to-have that might not justify the cost.

According to [TrustRadius](https://www.trustradius.com/products/teamtailor/reviews), the average user score is 8.7/10, with most negative reviews coming from enterprise users who outgrew it. Take that data point however you want.
