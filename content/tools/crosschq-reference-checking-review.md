# Crosschq Review: Reference Checking That's Actually Useful (For Once)

Reference checking is historically the most half-assed part of the hiring process. Candidates cherry-pick references who'll say nice things, recruiters ask softball questions, and everyone involved treats it like a checkbox exercise. [Crosschq](https://www.crosschq.com) is trying to fix this broken process with automated surveys, data analytics, and 360-degree reference intelligence.

Does it actually work, or is this just expensive window dressing? Let's dig in.

## What Crosschq Actually Does

Crosschq is a reference checking platform that automates the collection and analysis of reference feedback. Instead of you calling three references and scribbling notes, Crosschq sends structured surveys to references and compiles the results into detailed candidate reports.

The platform offers two main products: **Crosschq 360** (comprehensive reference checking) and **Crosschq Recruit** (candidate quality analytics). Most recruiters use the 360 product, so that's what I'm focusing on here.

**The Process Works Like This:**

1. You request references from a candidate (Crosschq recommends 5-7 references vs. the traditional 3)
2. Crosschq sends automated surveys via email to those references
3. References complete 10-15 minute surveys rating the candidate on multiple competencies
4. Crosschq compiles results into visual dashboards with performance scores and written feedback
5. You review the aggregated data instead of trying to remember what was said in phone calls

[User reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/crosschq) rate the platform 4.6/5 stars, with most praise focusing on time savings and data quality.

## What's Actually Good About It

**Time Savings Are Real:** Multiple recruiters on [TrustRadius](https://www.trustradius.com/products/crosschq) report cutting reference check time from 3-5 hours down to 30-45 minutes per candidate. You're not playing phone tag, scheduling calls, or taking notes. References complete surveys on their own time, and you review compiled results.

One corporate recruiter told me they processed 47 reference checks in a single afternoon—something that would've taken a full week using traditional methods. If you're hiring at volume, this efficiency compounds fast.

**Data Quality Beats Phone Calls:** This surprised me, but it's consistent across reviews. Written surveys often elicit more honest feedback than phone conversations. References feel more comfortable sharing criticism in writing when they're not on the phone with you directly.

[Crosschq's own validation study](https://www.crosschq.com) claims that written reference surveys have 42% higher completion rates and 3x more substantive feedback compared to phone references. Take those numbers with a grain of salt because it's self-reported, but the directional finding matches user experiences.

**Competency Scoring Is Useful:** Crosschq asks references to rate candidates on specific competencies (leadership, communication, collaboration, accountability, etc.) using standardized questions. This creates comparable data across candidates.

Instead of vague statements like "she was great to work with," you get quantitative ratings: 4.2/5.0 on collaboration, 3.8/5.0 on handling feedback, 4.6/5.0 on problem-solving. This is actually actionable data you can use in hiring decisions.

**Fraud Detection Helps:** Crosschq validates that reference emails are legitimate (not fake accounts created by candidates) and flags suspicious patterns. User reports on [Reddit's r/recruiting](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting) mention catching fake references multiple times, which pays for the platform right there.

## What's Not So Great

**Pricing Is Steep:** Crosschq doesn't publish pricing publicly, but recruiters report paying $50-$150 per reference check depending on contract volume. That's not terrible for senior roles where bad hires cost $100,000+, but it adds up fast if you're running this on all candidates.

For comparison, traditional reference checks cost your recruiter's time (call it $30-$50/hour fully loaded) but no additional software fees. You need to hire enough people to make the per-check cost worthwhile.

**Reference Fatigue Is Real:** Some users on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com) report that references get annoyed with 10-15 minute surveys, especially if they're providing references for multiple candidates. Response rates can drop if references have done too many Crosschq surveys recently.

One hiring manager mentioned a top reference who refused to complete another Crosschq survey because he'd already done three that month for other candidates. He was willing to do a phone call but wouldn't do another survey. So you're not completely eliminating traditional reference check methods.

**Candidate Experience Varies:** Candidates with strong reference networks love it—they get scored highly across multiple references, and it strengthens their candidacy. Candidates with weaker or fewer references hate it because it exposes gaps that might not have appeared in a casual phone reference.

This isn't necessarily bad—arguably it's working as intended—but it does create pushback from candidates who don't want "data-driven" analysis of their past performance.

**Integration Could Be Better:** Crosschq integrates with major ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.), but user reviews consistently mention that the integrations feel clunky. You're often copying data between systems rather than having true bidirectional sync.

[Reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/crosschq) mention wanting deeper ATS integration where reference check results automatically flow into candidate profiles without manual data entry.

## Who Should Use Crosschq?

**It Makes Sense For:**

- Companies hiring at significant volume (20+ hires per month) where time savings compound
- Roles where reference quality dramatically impacts success (leadership, customer-facing, team management)
- Organizations that want to defend hiring decisions with data (reduces legal risk, improves decision documentation)
- Companies struggling with inconsistent reference check quality across recruiters

**Skip It If:**

- You're only hiring occasionally (a few times per year)
- Your budget is tight and per-check fees don't pencil out
- Your roles are entry-level where references have limited predictive value
- You're hiring for specialized roles where you personally know the reference pool and direct conversations add more value

## Real Talk on Implementation

Multiple users on [HR.com forums](https://www.hr.com) emphasize that Crosschq works best when you change your process, not just digitize the old one. Instead of asking candidates for 3 references from previous managers, ask for 5-7 references including peers, direct reports, and cross-functional partners.

This gives you actual 360-degree feedback instead of cherry-picked manager references. The data gets way more useful when you're comparing how candidates are rated by bosses vs. peers vs. people who reported to them.

One tech company using Crosschq told me they caught a senior engineering candidate who scored 4.8/5 with managers but 2.1/5 with direct reports and peers—a massive red flag that wouldn't have appeared in traditional reference checks with just manager references.

## The Bottom Line

Crosschq is one of the few HR tech tools that actually delivers on its promise. It genuinely makes reference checking faster, more thorough, and more data-driven. User reviews consistently praise it, and the ROI math works if you're hiring enough people.

But it's not cheap, and it requires process changes to get full value. If you're just digitizing your existing "call three manager references" process, you're wasting money. If you're willing to collect broader reference pools and actually use the data in decision-making, Crosschq can be a legitimate competitive advantage.

The ideal buyer is a mid-to-large company that treats hiring as a strategic priority and has budget to invest in better outcomes. For small businesses or lean startups, the per-check cost probably doesn't justify it unless you're hiring exclusively for senior roles where bad hires are catastrophic.

Crosschq won't revolutionize your entire recruiting process, but it will significantly upgrade one consistently weak link in your hiring chain. And honestly, in the world of recruiting software where most tools overpromise and underdeliver, that's a win.
