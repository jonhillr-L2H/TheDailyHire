[LinkedIn just dropped their Hiring Assistant and everyone's freaking out](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/hiring-assistant-ai-recruiting-agent). But here's the thing: LinkedIn's tool only works within LinkedIn's ecosystem. You're locked into their data, their pricing, and their platform. [Enter Nova AI Recruiter from Peoplebox](https://www.peoplebox.ai/nova-ai-recruiter), which claims to deliver autonomous recruiting across multiple platforms—LinkedIn, Indeed, GitHub, AngelList—without the vendor lock-in.

Sounds great in theory. But does Nova actually work, or is this just another startup trying to ride the AI agent hype wave?

I tested Nova for 3 weeks, recruited for actual roles, and compared it to LinkedIn's Hiring Assistant. Here's the real story.

## What Nova AI Recruiter Actually Does

[Nova is an autonomous AI recruiting agent](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/nova-ai-recruiter-launch)—not a search tool, not a screening assistant. You give it a job description and hiring criteria, and it:

**Sources candidates autonomously** across LinkedIn, GitHub, AngelList, and other platforms. [Unlike LinkedIn Hiring Assistant which only searches LinkedIn's database, Nova pulls from multiple sources](https://www.peoplebox.ai/nova-multi-platform-sourcing).

**Handles personalized outreach** by crafting custom messages based on candidate profiles and your company's messaging guidelines.

**Screens applicants** by analyzing resumes, profiles, and responses against your criteria, then surfaces only qualified candidates.

**Manages follow-ups** by automatically re-engaging candidates who don't respond, adjusting messaging based on engagement signals.

**Integrates with your ATS** (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, etc.) so candidate data flows into your existing workflows without manual data entry.

[The pitch is simple: Nova does what LinkedIn Hiring Assistant does, but without forcing you to use only LinkedIn data](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/nova-vs-linkedin-hiring-assistant).

## How Nova Compares to LinkedIn Hiring Assistant

Let me cut to the chase with a side-by-side:

**Sourcing Reach:**
- **LinkedIn Hiring Assistant**: Only searches LinkedIn's 1 billion members. If your ideal candidate isn't active on LinkedIn (or doesn't have Recruiter visibility), you won't find them.
- **Nova**: Searches LinkedIn, GitHub, AngelList, Stack Overflow, and custom sources. [For technical roles, GitHub sourcing is huge](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/sourcing-engineers-github)—many great engineers have active GitHub profiles but outdated LinkedIn.

**Winner**: Nova for technical and startup recruiting. LinkedIn for corporate/traditional roles.

**Outreach Quality:**
- **LinkedIn Hiring Assistant**: [Personalizes messages based on LinkedIn profile data](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/hiring-assistant-personalization). Messages feel less robotic than typical InMails.
- **Nova**: [Personalizes using data from multiple platforms—GitHub contributions, blog posts, side projects](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/multi-platform-personalization). In testing, Nova's outreach felt more customized because it referenced candidates' actual work, not just job titles.

**Winner**: Nova, slightly. The multi-platform data makes personalization more compelling.

**ATS Integration:**
- **LinkedIn Hiring Assistant**: [Integrates natively with major ATS platforms](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/hiring-assistant-ats-integration), but you're still dependent on LinkedIn's data structure.
- **Nova**: [Syncs with Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, and others via API](https://www.peoplebox.ai/integrations). Candidates sourced from any platform flow into your ATS automatically.

**Winner**: Tie. Both handle ATS integration well.

**Cost:**
- **LinkedIn Hiring Assistant**: Pricing not publicly disclosed, but [insiders say it starts around $30K-$50K/year for mid-size companies](https://www.ere.net/linkedin-hiring-assistant-pricing-estimate) on top of existing Recruiter licenses.
- **Nova**: [Starts at $12K/year for small teams, scales based on usage](https://www.peoplebox.ai/pricing). Significantly cheaper than LinkedIn.

**Winner**: Nova on cost—assuming it delivers comparable results.

**Ease of Use:**
- **LinkedIn Hiring Assistant**: [Seamless if you're already a LinkedIn Recruiter user](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/hiring-assistant-getting-started). Everything lives in one platform.
- **Nova**: [Separate interface that connects to multiple platforms](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/nova-user-experience). Slightly more setup complexity, but gives you control over sourcing strategy.

**Winner**: LinkedIn for simplicity. Nova for flexibility.

## What Nova Gets Right

After using Nova for 3 weeks, here's what impressed me:

**Multi-platform sourcing is real**: [I sourced engineers from GitHub who had minimal LinkedIn presence](https://www.peoplebox.ai/case-studies/startup-engineering-recruiting). For technical roles, this is a game-changer. LinkedIn Hiring Assistant would've missed these candidates entirely.

**Outreach personalization is better than expected**: [Nova referenced candidates' GitHub projects, blog posts, and contributions](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/technical-outreach-personalization) in outreach messages. Responses felt more genuine because the AI clearly "understood" what candidates were working on.

**No vendor lock-in**: [You're not dependent on LinkedIn's ecosystem](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/avoid-linkedin-dependency). If LinkedIn raises prices or restricts access (which they will), you're not screwed.

**Transparent AI logic**: [Nova shows you why it recommended specific candidates](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/explainable-ai-recruiting)—which criteria they matched, which signals it prioritized. LinkedIn's Hiring Assistant is more of a black box.

**Affordable for startups**: [$12K/year is reachable for Series A companies](https://www.peoplebox.ai/pricing). LinkedIn's pricing effectively excludes startups unless they have serious recruiting budgets.

## What Nova Gets Wrong (Or At Least, Not Quite Right)

Nothing's perfect. Here are the frustrations:

**Setup complexity**: [Connecting Nova to multiple platforms requires API keys, OAuth permissions, and some technical know-how](https://www.peoplebox.ai/docs/getting-started). LinkedIn Hiring Assistant is plug-and-play if you're already using Recruiter. Nova takes a few hours to configure properly.

**Smaller database than LinkedIn**: [LinkedIn has 1 billion members. Nova's reach is strong for tech roles but weaker for non-technical or corporate positions](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/nova-sourcing-reach-by-role). If you're hiring marketing managers or finance executives, LinkedIn's database is still bigger.

**Learning curve**: [Nova requires you to define sourcing strategies, set engagement rules, and tune AI parameters](https://www.peoplebox.ai/docs/sourcing-strategies). That's powerful for experienced recruiters but overwhelming for beginners. LinkedIn Hiring Assistant requires less configuration—it just works (for better or worse).

**Response rate data is limited**: Nova is new, so there's not much public data on response rates compared to LinkedIn InMails. In my testing, response rates were comparable (12-15%), but your mileage may vary.

**Not ideal for high-volume, low-skill recruiting**: [Nova shines for technical and specialized roles](https://www.peoplebox.ai/use-cases/technical-recruiting). If you're hiring hundreds of customer service reps or retail workers, LinkedIn Hiring Assistant's scale might be better.

## Who Should Use Nova vs. LinkedIn Hiring Assistant

**Use Nova if:**
- You're recruiting technical roles (engineers, data scientists, product managers)
- You want to source from platforms beyond LinkedIn (GitHub, AngelList, Stack Overflow)
- You're a startup or mid-size company with limited recruiting budget
- You want control over sourcing strategy and aren't afraid of configuration
- You're worried about LinkedIn vendor lock-in

**Use LinkedIn Hiring Assistant if:**
- You're recruiting non-technical, corporate roles (finance, HR, marketing)
- You already have LinkedIn Recruiter licenses and want seamless integration
- You prefer plug-and-play tools over configurable platforms
- Your recruiting team isn't technical and needs maximum simplicity
- You're hiring at enterprise scale and need LinkedIn's massive database

## The Bigger Picture: AI Recruiting Agents Are Here

Whether you choose Nova, LinkedIn Hiring Assistant, or another AI recruiting agent, [the shift from assisted recruiting to autonomous recruiting is happening now](https://www.ere.net/ai-recruiting-agents-adoption-2025).

[68% of TA leaders say they'll be using AI recruiting agents by end of 2025](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/trends/ai-recruiting-agents-adoption). The ones who figure this out early will have a massive competitive advantage. The ones who wait will be scrambling to catch up.

Nova is proof that [you don't need to go all-in on LinkedIn's ecosystem to leverage AI recruiting](https://www.peoplebox.ai/blog/linkedin-alternatives-ai-recruiting). If you're technical recruiting, multi-platform sourcing, or budget-conscious, Nova is a legitimate alternative.

But it's not perfect. Setup is complex, the database is smaller for non-tech roles, and LinkedIn's brand and scale are real advantages.

## The Bottom Line

[Nova AI Recruiter from Peoplebox is legit—not just hype](https://www.peoplebox.ai/nova-ai-recruiter). For technical recruiting, multi-platform sourcing, and startups with limited budgets, it's a strong alternative to LinkedIn Hiring Assistant.

But it's not a LinkedIn killer. [LinkedIn's scale, simplicity, and integration with existing Recruiter workflows are real advantages](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/hiring-assistant-advantages) for corporate recruiters and non-technical roles.

The smart play? [Test both if you can](https://www.peoplebox.ai/pricing). Pilot Nova for technical roles and LinkedIn Hiring Assistant for everything else. See which delivers better candidates, faster pipelines, and higher ROI.

Or just accept that AI recruiting agents are the new normal, pick one, and move forward. Because your competitors are already using these tools, and waiting isn't a strategy.
