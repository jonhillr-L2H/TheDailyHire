Posting jobs to multiple job boards manually is tedious. Each board has different formatting requirements, posting processes, and pricing.

Job board aggregators promise to solve this: post once, distribute to 100+ boards automatically.

The reality: some aggregators deliver quality applicants from relevant boards. Others spam your job to obscure sites you've never heard of, generating floods of unqualified applications.

Here's which aggregators actually work (and which ones waste your money generating noise).

## What Job Board Aggregators Actually Do

Job board aggregators distribute job postings across multiple sites from one interface:

**Multi-board posting**: One click posts to multiple job boards simultaneously
**Centralized management**: Edit and remove postings from one dashboard
**Application aggregation**: Collect applications from all boards in one place
**Analytics**: Track which boards generate applications and hires
**Pricing consolidation**: One bill instead of paying each board separately

The value proposition: save time and potentially reduce cost compared to posting individually.

The risk: getting application volume without application quality.

## ZipRecruiter: The Largest Aggregator Network

ZipRecruiter is the most established job board aggregator, distributing to 100+ sites.

**Pricing:** Starts at $249/month for unlimited job postings.

**What it does well:**

**Massive distribution**: Posts to Indeed, LinkedIn, Facebook, Monster, CareerBuilder, and 100+ niche boards automatically.

**AI matching**: Proactively suggests candidates from ZipRecruiter's database who match your job.

**Simple interface**: Post jobs easily, manage applications in one dashboard.

**Mobile-friendly**: Candidates can apply via mobile, increasing completion rates.

**Flat-rate pricing**: Unlimited postings for one monthly fee (unlike pay-per-post boards).

**What to consider:**

**Application quality varies**: High volume but not all applicants are qualified. Requires screening.

**Less control**: Can't choose which specific boards receive your posting (ZipRecruiter decides).

**Jobs appear on low-quality boards**: Your posting may end up on obscure sites you wouldn't choose manually.

**Best for:** Companies hiring for common roles (admin, sales, customer service) who need volume and can screen applications.

**Skip if:** You're hiring specialized roles where quality matters more than volume, or want control over which boards get your jobs.

## Broadbean: The Enterprise Aggregator

Broadbean serves large enterprises with complex posting needs across geographies.

**Pricing:** Custom enterprise pricing.

**What it does well:**

**Granular control**: Choose exactly which boards get which jobs (unlike ZipRecruiter's automatic distribution).

**Global reach**: Posts to international job boards across 190+ countries.

**ATS integration**: Deep integration with enterprise ATS platforms (Workday, SAP, iCIMS).

**Compliance**: Handles country-specific posting requirements and data privacy regulations.

**Analytics**: Detailed reporting on board performance, cost-per-application, quality-of-hire by source.

**What to consider:**

**Enterprise complexity**: Setup requires IT involvement and configuration.

**Expensive**: Only cost-effective for high-volume hiring operations.

**Overkill for small companies**: Features designed for global enterprises, not small teams.

**Best for:** Large enterprises (1,000+ employees) hiring across multiple countries who need control and compliance.

**Skip if:** You're a small company, hire domestically only, or need simple setup.

## Jobg8: The UK/Europe Specialist

Jobg8 focuses on UK and European job board aggregation.

**Pricing:** Pay-per-posting or subscription models available.

**What it does well:**

**UK/Europe coverage**: Strong connections to regional boards (Reed, Totaljobs, CV-Library, StepStone, etc.).

**Flexible pricing**: Choose boards and pay only for those (more control than ZipRecruiter).

**ATS integration**: Works with major UK-used ATS platforms.

**What to consider:**

**Regional focus**: Only valuable if hiring in UK/Europe.

**Smaller network than global aggregators**: Fewer boards than ZipRecruiter or Broadbean.

**Best for:** UK and European companies hiring domestically.

**Skip if:** You're hiring in North America or globally.

## Google for Jobs: The Free Alternative

Google for Jobs isn't an aggregator you pay for—it's a free aggregation service.

**How it works:**

Post jobs on your career site with proper schema markup, and Google crawls and displays them in search results. No cost.

**Pros:**
- Free
- High visibility (shows up in Google search)
- No third-party job board fees

**Cons:**
- Requires technical setup (schema markup on your career site)
- No applicant tracking (candidates go to your site to apply)
- Less control over presentation

**Best for:** Companies with technical resources who want free job distribution.

## Do You Actually Need A Job Board Aggregator?

Not always. Consider:

**You probably need an aggregator if:**
- You're hiring for multiple roles simultaneously
- You post to 5+ job boards regularly
- You want centralized application management
- Time savings justify the cost

**You probably don't need an aggregator if:**
- You hire infrequently (1-3 roles per year)
- You focus on specialized boards (niche industry sites)
- Your ATS has built-in multi-posting
- Direct sourcing fills most roles

**Alternatives to aggregators:**
- Post directly to 2-3 high-quality boards (Indeed, LinkedIn)
- Use your ATS's built-in multi-posting (if available)
- Leverage Google for Jobs (free)
- Focus on direct sourcing and employee referrals

## The Bottom Line

Job board aggregators save time but don't guarantee quality.

**Choose based on:**
- **Volume needs:** High-volume hiring benefits from aggregators
- **Quality requirements:** Specialized roles may need targeted posting over broad distribution
- **Budget:** Aggregators are cost-effective only at scale
- **Control preference:** Want to choose boards (Broadbean) or accept automatic distribution (ZipRecruiter)?

And remember: application volume means nothing if most applicants are unqualified. Focus on source quality, not just quantity.
