Skills testing platforms have a terrible reputation. Most are clunky, take way too long, ask irrelevant questions, and make candidates want to throw their laptops out windows.

[Toggl Hire](https://toggl.com/hire/) is trying to fix this. It's a skills assessment platform focused on quick, practical tests that actually measure job-relevant abilities—without wasting candidates' time or recruiters' sanity.

**The verdict: It's refreshingly simple, affordable, and effective for screening candidates based on actual skills instead of keyword-stuffed resumes.**

## What Toggl Hire Actually Does

[Toggl Hire is a pre-employment skills testing platform](https://toggl.com/hire/features/):

**Pre-built skill tests**: [200+ ready-made tests covering common roles and skills](https://toggl.com/hire/skills-tests/)—marketing, sales, customer support, software development, data analysis, writing, accounting, etc.

**Custom test creation**: [Build your own tests with multiple choice, open-ended questions, file uploads, or video responses](https://toggl.com/hire/features/custom-tests/).

**Auto-grading**: [Objective questions grade automatically](https://toggl.com/hire/features/auto-grading/). [Subjective answers (essays, case studies) require manual review](https://support.toggl.com/en/articles/toggl-hire-grading-options).

**Candidate ranking**: [System ranks candidates by test performance](https://toggl.com/hire/features/candidate-ranking/). [Shows top performers first so recruiters review the best candidates immediately](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/skills-assessment-ranking-tools-2025).

**ATS integration**: [Integrates with major ATS platforms](https://toggl.com/hire/integrations/)—Greenhouse, Lever, BambooHR, Workable. [Can also be used standalone](https://support.toggl.com/en/articles/toggl-hire-standalone-usage).

**Branded candidate experience**: [Customize tests with your company branding, logos, and messaging](https://toggl.com/hire/features/employer-branding/).

**Anti-cheating features**: [Webcam proctoring, time limits, question randomization, tab-switching detection](https://toggl.com/hire/features/anti-cheating/). [Not foolproof but reduces obvious cheating](https://www.hrdive.com/news/skills-testing-anti-cheating-effectiveness-2025/).

## What Makes It Actually Good

**Tests are short**: [Most tests take 10-15 minutes, not 60-90 minutes like some platforms](https://toggl.com/hire/features/quick-tests/). [Candidates can complete them on lunch breaks without blocking entire afternoons](https://www.talentculture.com/candidate-assessment-length-completion-rates/).

**Questions are practical**: [Tests focus on real job tasks, not academic trivia](https://toggl.com/hire/skills-tests/). [Marketing tests ask candidates to write email subject lines or analyze campaign data, not recite textbook definitions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/practical-skills-assessment-design-2025).

**Mobile-friendly**: [Candidates can take tests on phones or tablets](https://toggl.com/hire/features/mobile-experience/). [Actually works well on mobile—not just technically accessible](https://www.capterra.com/p/181432/Toggl-Hire/reviews/mobile-functionality).

**Fast to set up**: [Pre-built tests can be deployed in minutes](https://toggl.com/hire/features/quick-setup/). [Pick a test template, customize a few questions if desired, send to candidates](https://www.g2.com/products/toggl-hire/reviews/ease-of-setup).

**Affordable pricing**: [Starts at $20/month for small teams](https://toggl.com/hire/pricing/). [Even enterprise pricing is reasonable compared to competitors like HireVue or Criteria](https://www.trustradius.com/products/toggl-hire/reviews/pricing-comparison).

**Clean interface**: [Intuitive for both recruiters and candidates](https://www.g2.com/products/toggl-hire/reviews/user-interface-feedback). [No extensive training needed to use effectively](https://www.capterra.com/p/181432/Toggl-Hire/reviews/ease-of-use).

## What It Lacks

**Not for complex assessments**: [This isn't for coding challenges, lengthy case studies, or multi-hour technical evaluations](https://toggl.com/hire/features/test-types/). [It's designed for quick screening, not deep technical validation](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/skills-assessment-platform-capabilities-comparison).

**Limited advanced proctoring**: [Anti-cheating features are basic compared to dedicated proctoring platforms](https://www.hrdive.com/news/assessment-proctoring-comparison-2025/). [Webcam monitoring is available but not as sophisticated as Proctorio or HireVue](https://www.trustradius.com/products/toggl-hire/reviews/proctoring-limitations).

**Subjective grading still manual**: [Essay questions, case studies, and open-ended responses require human review](https://support.toggl.com/en/articles/toggl-hire-manual-grading). [No AI-assisted grading like some competitors offer](https://www.talentculture.com/ai-assessment-grading-tools-2025/).

**Video interview limitations**: [Video response questions exist but platform isn't designed as a comprehensive video interviewing tool](https://toggl.com/hire/features/video-questions/). [If video interviews are your primary screening method, dedicated platforms like Spark Hire work better](https://www.g2.com/compare/toggl-hire-vs-spark-hire).

**Reporting is basic**: [Candidate ranking and pass/fail data are clear, but advanced analytics are limited](https://www.trustradius.com/products/toggl-hire/reviews/reporting-analytics). [No deep psychometric analysis or predictive validity studies](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/assessment-analytics-capabilities-2025).

## Real User Feedback

From [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/toggl-hire/reviews), [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/181432/Toggl-Hire/reviews/), and [TrustRadius](https://www.trustradius.com/products/toggl-hire/reviews):

**Positive:**
- "Candidates actually complete the tests. Our completion rate is 85%+."
- "Dramatically reduced time spent screening unqualified resumes. We only interview candidates who pass skills tests."
- "Affordable. We're paying $100/month vs. $500+ for previous assessment platform."
- "Setup was incredibly easy. Had tests deployed within an hour of signing up."
- "Pre-built tests are surprisingly good. We use them with minimal customization."

**Negative:**
- "Not suitable for complex technical assessments. Works for screening, not deep evaluation."
- "We still need to manually review essay-style answers—no AI grading assistance."
- "Anti-cheating features are basic. Sophisticated cheaters could probably game the system."
- "Reporting could be more detailed. We export data and analyze in Excel."
- "Video question functionality exists but isn't as robust as dedicated video interview platforms."

## How It Compares To Alternatives

**Criteria Corp**: [More scientifically validated assessments, better psychometric rigor](https://www.criteriacorp.com). [Also more expensive and tests take longer](https://www.g2.com/compare/criteria-corp-vs-toggl-hire).

**TestGorilla**: [Similar concept, larger test library](https://www.testgorilla.com). [Comparable pricing and features](https://www.capterra.com/compare/toggl-hire-vs-testgorilla). [Choice often comes down to specific test content preferences](https://www.trustradius.com/compare-products/toggl-hire-vs-testgorilla).

**HireVue Assessments**: [More comprehensive platform with video interviewing and game-based assessments](https://www.hirevue.com/products/assessments). [Significantly more expensive and complex](https://www.g2.com/compare/hirevue-vs-toggl-hire).

**Codility** (for tech roles): [Dedicated platform for coding assessments with sophisticated code evaluation](https://www.codility.com). [Better for technical hiring, but limited to software development roles](https://www.g2.com/compare/codility-vs-toggl-hire).

**Wonderlic**: [Classic cognitive ability testing with strong validity research](https://www.wonderlic.com). [More academic/abstract, less job-specific than Toggl Hire's practical tests](https://www.trustradius.com/compare-products/toggl-hire-vs-wonderlic).

## Best Use Cases

**What Toggl Hire is perfect for:**
- High-volume hiring where resume screening is overwhelming (customer support, sales, marketing)
- Eliminating obviously unqualified candidates before phone screens
- Validating skills claimed on resumes (Excel proficiency, writing ability, basic coding)
- Small-to-mid size companies wanting affordable skills testing without enterprise complexity
- Roles where a 10-15 minute practical test reveals core competency

**What it's not ideal for:**
- Senior/executive hiring where assessments feel inappropriate
- Deep technical evaluation requiring 2-4 hour coding challenges
- Roles where skills testing could alienate top candidates (highly competitive markets)
- Organizations needing extensive psychometric validation and predictive analytics
- Complex, multi-stage assessment processes requiring sophisticated proctoring

## The Bottom Line

[Toggl Hire is excellent at what it's designed to do: quick, practical skills screening that's easy to use and affordable](https://www.capterra.com/p/181432/Toggl-Hire/reviews/overall-rating). [It won't replace comprehensive technical assessments or in-depth evaluation, but it's fantastic for initial screening](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/skills-testing-screening-stage-2025).

[The tests are short enough that candidates actually complete them, practical enough to reveal real competency, and cheap enough that even small teams can afford them](https://www.g2.com/products/toggl-hire/reviews/value-proposition).

[If you're drowning in unqualified applicants and need a fast, effective way to identify candidates with actual skills before investing time in interviews, Toggl Hire solves that problem](https://www.hrdive.com/news/skills-testing-resume-screening-alternative-2025/).

[If you need enterprise-grade assessments with extensive validation studies, sophisticated proctoring, and advanced psychometrics, look at Criteria or HireVue](https://www.trustradius.com/compare-products/skills-assessment-platforms-2025).

**Rating: 8/10** - Excellent for what it does (quick, practical skills screening), affordable, and easy to use. Not meant for complex assessments, but that's not the point.
