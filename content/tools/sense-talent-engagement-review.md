# Sense - AI-Powered Talent Engagement and Communication

Sense wants to be your intelligent communication layer between you and your talent pool. It's CRM meets marketing automation meets AI chatbot, all aimed at keeping candidates engaged without you manually sending 500 text messages a day.

## What's Under the Hood

Sense is fundamentally about automated, personalized communication at scale. It sits on top of your ATS (integrates with most major platforms) and handles candidate engagement through text, email, and chat. The AI chatbot can answer candidate questions, schedule interviews, send updates, and keep people warm without human intervention.

The platform learns from your interactions and gets smarter about when and how to engage candidates. It's trying to solve the problem where candidates ghost you because they haven't heard anything in two weeks, or because they applied and got zero response.

## Where It Actually Helps

If you've got a decent-sized talent pipeline and struggle with candidate communication, Sense can save hours of manual work. The SMS capability is genuinely useful - text response rates destroy email, and candidates actually prefer it for quick updates.

Campaign building is intuitive. You can set up nurture sequences for different candidate segments, trigger messages based on candidate actions, and keep your pipeline warm without constant manual touchpoints. The chatbot handles the repetitive stuff - "What's the salary range?" "Where are you in the process?" "When can I expect to hear back?"

Analytics show you engagement rates, response rates, and conversion metrics. You can see what's working and what's getting ignored.

## The Reality

The AI is good, not magic. It handles straightforward queries well but escalates to humans when things get complex. That's actually the right design - you don't want a bot making promises your company can't keep or bungling sensitive conversations.

Implementation requires some work upfront. You need to configure your messaging, set up workflows, and train the system on your specific use cases. It's not plug-and-play on day one.

Pricing scales with usage, which makes sense but can get expensive if you're running massive volumes. The ROI depends heavily on how much recruiter time you're currently burning on repetitive communication.

## Who Should Care

Sense makes sense (sorry) for mid-to-large recruiting teams who have built a talent pool but struggle to maintain relationships with candidates. If you're doing high-volume hiring where candidates wait in various stages, the automated engagement keeps them from ghosting.

If you're a small team hiring occasionally, you probably don't need this level of automation. Just send the damn texts yourself.

Check real user feedback on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/sense/reviews) and [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/178854/Sense/) before you commit. Look specifically for reviews from companies similar to yours in size and hiring volume.

## Bottom Line

Sense solves a real problem: candidate communication at scale. It won't fix a broken recruiting process, but it can make a decent process significantly more efficient. Know your communication pain points before you demo, and make sure the tool actually addresses them.

Not every problem needs an AI solution, but candidate engagement might actually be one that does.
