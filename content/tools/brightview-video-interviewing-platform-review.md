**BrightView** is a video interviewing platform designed to replace first-round phone screens with asynchronous video interviews.

Candidates record answers to pre-set questions on their own time. Recruiters review responses later.

**Promise:** Save time on initial screens and eliminate scheduling back-and-forth.

**Reality:** It works well for high-volume non-technical hiring, but struggles with technical roles and candidate experience issues.

**Pricing:** $299/month for up to 100 interviews, $599/month for unlimited

**We tested it for 60 days across 8 roles.**

## What BrightView Does

**Core features:**
- Pre-recorded question banks (or create custom questions)
- Candidates record video responses on their schedule
- AI transcription and keyword analysis
- Side-by-side candidate comparison
- Shareable interview links for hiring teams

**Target users:** Recruiters handling high-volume hiring (retail, customer support, sales)

**The pitch:** Eliminate phone screen scheduling and pre-screen candidates faster.

## What Works Well

### 1. Saves Time On High-Volume Roles

For roles with 50+ applicants, BrightView significantly reduces time-to-screen.

**Old process:**
- Schedule 20 phone screens
- Spend 30 minutes per call
- Total time: 10+ hours

**With BrightView:**
- Send video interview link to all 20 candidates
- Review 20 recorded responses at 1.5x speed
- Total time: 4 hours

**For customer support and sales roles, this saved us 6+ hours per position.**

### 2. Candidate Comparison Feature Is Excellent

You can watch multiple candidates' answers to the same question side-by-side.

**Example:**

"How would you handle an angry customer?"

**Candidate A:** Focused on de-escalation and empathy
**Candidate B:** Focused on policy and procedure
**Candidate C:** Rambling answer, no clear strategy

**This made it easy to identify top performers quickly.**

### 3. AI Transcription Is Accurate

The AI transcribes candidate responses with 90%+ accuracy.

**Pros:**
- Searchable transcripts (find candidates who mentioned specific skills)
- Helpful for reviewing answers without re-watching video
- Good for accessibility

### 4. Flexible Scheduling

Candidates complete interviews on their schedule. No more "Are you available Tuesday at 2?" emails.

**Candidates appreciated this flexibility.**

**One candidate:** "I loved being able to record my interview after work instead of taking PTO for a phone screen."

## What Doesn't Work Well

### 1. Technical Candidates Hate It

We tried using BrightView for software engineer phone screens.

**Candidate feedback:**
- "I can't ask clarifying questions about the technical question"
- "This feels impersonal and robotic"
- "I prefer talking through my thought process live"

**5 out of 8 technical candidates withdrew after receiving the video interview link.**

**One candidate:** "If this is how your company interviews, I'm not interested. I want to talk to real people."

**For technical roles, live interviews are still better.**

### 2. No Way To Do Technical Assessments

You can't ask candidates to share their screen or write code.

**For technical roles, this is a dealbreaker.**

BrightView works for "tell me about a time when..." questions, but not for hands-on skill evaluation.

### 3. Candidate Drop-Off Is High

**Our completion rates:**

- Customer support roles: 78% of candidates completed the video interview
- Sales roles: 71% completed
- Software engineering roles: 43% completed (many withdrew instead)

**Many candidates find asynchronous video interviews awkward and impersonal.**

**We lost candidates who would have done well in a live phone screen.**

### 4. AI Keyword Analysis Is Overly Simplistic

BrightView's AI flags candidates who use certain keywords.

**Example:** For a customer support role, it flagged candidates who mentioned "empathy" and "problem-solving."

**Problem:** The AI doesn't understand context.

**Candidate A:** "I believe empathy is important" (flagged as strong)
**Candidate B:** "Some people talk about empathy, but I focus on solving problems quickly" (flagged as weak, despite giving a good answer)

**The AI keyword matching isn't sophisticated enough to replace human judgment.**

### 5. Time Limits Stress Candidates

You can set time limits for responses (e.g., 2 minutes per question).

**Candidates get a countdown timer while recording.**

**Multiple candidates told us this was stressful:**

- "I felt rushed and couldn't articulate my full answer"
- "The timer made me nervous and I blanked"

**We turned off time limits after Week 2.**

## Pricing And ROI

**Plans:**
- Starter: $299/month (up to 100 interviews)
- Professional: $599/month (unlimited interviews)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (includes API access and custom branding)

**ROI calculation:**

If you're hiring for 5+ high-volume roles per month, BrightView pays for itself in recruiter time saved.

**But:** Factor in candidate drop-off. If you lose 30% of candidates due to the impersonal experience, the time savings might not be worth it.

## Who Should Use BrightView

**Good fit for:**
- High-volume hiring (retail, customer support, sales)
- Companies receiving 50+ applications per role
- Roles where phone screens are primarily behavioral questions
- Distributed hiring teams (easy to share video interviews)

**Not a good fit for:**
- Technical roles requiring live coding or problem-solving
- Senior-level roles where candidate experience matters
- Small teams hiring 1-2 people per quarter (not enough volume to justify cost)

## Alternatives To Consider

**If BrightView doesn't fit:**

- **Spark Hire** (similar platform, better technical interview features)
- **Modern Hire** (more enterprise-focused, includes assessments)
- **Zoom/Google Meet** (for live interviews with more personal touch)

## The Bottom Line

**BrightView works well for:**
- High-volume, non-technical first-round screens
- Saving recruiter time on scheduling
- Comparing candidates side-by-side

**BrightView struggles with:**
- Technical roles (candidates hate it)
- Candidate drop-off (30%+ don't complete interviews)
- Senior roles requiring personal touch

**Our recommendation:**

Use BrightView for high-volume, entry-to-mid-level non-technical roles. Stick with live phone/video screens for technical and senior positions.

**Rating: 7/10** (Great for specific use cases, but not a universal solution)

**Pros:**
✅ Saves significant time on high-volume hiring
✅ Excellent candidate comparison features
✅ Accurate AI transcription
✅ Flexible scheduling for candidates

**Cons:**
❌ High candidate drop-off, especially for technical roles
❌ Impersonal candidate experience
❌ AI keyword analysis is too simplistic
❌ Not suitable for technical assessments

**Price:** $299-$599/month depending on volume
