You're a team of 15 people. You hire maybe 10 people per year. And your recruiting tech budget is approximately $zero.

[Enterprise ATS platforms like Greenhouse and Lever want $30K-$50K annually](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ats-pricing-2025). That's not happening. But you also can't track candidates in a spreadsheet anymore because it's chaos.

You need an ATS that's actually built for small businesses—affordable, simple, and capable of handling 10-20 hires without requiring a dedicated recruiting ops person to manage it.

Here's what works.

## What Small Businesses Actually Need In An ATS

Before comparing platforms, understand what small businesses DON'T need:

❌ **Advanced reporting and analytics**: You're making 10 hires. You don't need 47 custom dashboards.

❌ **Complex workflow automation**: Your hiring process is "screen → interview → offer." You don't need 12-stage pipelines.

❌ **White-glove implementation**: You can't afford months of onboarding. You need something that works immediately.

❌ **Unlimited integrations**: You're not using 15 different HR tools. Basic integrations are fine.

**What you DO need:**

✅ **Affordable** ($100-$500/month, not $5K/month)

✅ **Simple to set up** (hours, not weeks)

✅ **Easy for hiring managers to use** (they're not recruiters—interface matters)

✅ **Good candidate experience** (career site, mobile-friendly applications)

✅ **Basic collaboration** (hiring managers can review candidates, provide feedback)

✅ **Compliance** (EEOC data collection, record retention)

[Small business ATS platforms should be simple, affordable, and require zero specialized knowledge to operate](https://www.capterra.com/applicant-tracking-software/small-business/).

## Breezy HR: The Budget-Friendly Favorite

[Breezy HR is designed specifically for small and mid-size businesses](https://www.breezy.hr/).

**Pricing:** Starts at $189/month for up to 3 users. Scales to $359/month for unlimited users and positions.

**What it does well:**

**Affordable**: [At under $200/month, this is accessible for most small businesses](https://www.breezy.hr/pricing). You can actually afford it.

**Easy setup**: [Most teams are live within a day](https://www.g2.com/products/breezy/reviews). No technical implementation required.

**Candidate experience**: [Branded career pages, simple application forms, mobile-friendly interface](https://www.breezy.hr/features/career-site). Candidates don't hate applying.

**Collaboration tools**: [Hiring managers can review candidates, leave ratings and comments, and participate without training](https://www.breezy.hr/features/collaboration).

**Job board posting**: [One-click posting to Indeed, LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, and other major boards](https://www.breezy.hr/features/job-distribution).

**Chrome extension**: [Source candidates from LinkedIn and save them directly to Breezy](https://www.breezy.hr/features/sourcing).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Limited advanced features**: [No AI matching, limited automation, basic reporting](https://www.capterra.com/p/149194/Breezy-HR/reviews). But small businesses don't need those anyway.

**Support could be better**: [Email support is solid, but phone support costs extra](https://www.trustradius.com/products/breezy-hr/reviews).

**Customization limits**: [You can't build complex workflows or deeply customize the interface](https://www.g2.com/products/breezy/reviews).

**Best for:** Small businesses (5-50 employees) making 5-20 hires per year who want something affordable and simple.

**Skip if:** You're hiring high-volume (50+ hires/year) or need advanced analytics and automation.

## JazzHR: The Feature-Rich Small Business Option

[JazzHR positions itself as "powerful enough for enterprises, priced for small businesses"](https://www.jazzhr.com/).

**Pricing:** Starts at $75/month (1 user, 2 jobs). Hero tier at $359/month gets you unlimited users and jobs.

**What it does well:**

**Flexible pricing**: [You can start super cheap if you're only hiring for 1-2 roles](https://www.jazzhr.com/pricing), then scale up.

**Robust feature set**: [More features than Breezy—advanced interview scheduling, SMS communication, offer letter templates](https://www.jazzhr.com/features).

**Candidate texting**: [Built-in SMS allows you to text candidates directly from the platform](https://www.jazzhr.com/features/texting). Improves response rates significantly.

**Integrations**: [Connects with QuickBooks, Slack, Google Calendar, and other small business tools](https://www.jazzhr.com/integrations).

**Compliance support**: [EEOC reporting, OFCCP compliance, veteran and disability self-ID](https://www.jazzhr.com/features/compliance).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Pricing can get confusing**: [Different tiers have different limits on users, jobs, and features](https://www.capterra.com/p/132017/JazzHR/reviews). Make sure you understand what you're paying for.

**Learning curve**: [More features mean more complexity](https://www.g2.com/products/jazzhr/reviews). Not quite as plug-and-play as Breezy.

**UI feels dated**: [The interface works but isn't modern or beautiful](https://www.trustradius.com/products/jazzhr/reviews).

**Best for:** Small businesses that want more features and customization than Breezy offers but can't afford enterprise platforms.

**Skip if:** You want the absolute simplest solution or have a tiny budget ($75/month might not be enough—you'll likely need the $359 tier).

## Freshteam: The Free-Tier Option

[Freshteam by Freshworks offers a genuinely useful free tier](https://www.freshworks.com/hrms/applicant-tracking-system/).

**Pricing:** Free for unlimited users, up to 50 employees. Paid plans start at $71/month per recruiter.

**What it does well:**

**Actually free**: [The free tier isn't a trial—it's permanent](https://www.freshworks.com/hrms/pricing/). If you're under 50 employees, you can use Freshteam forever without paying.

**HR management included**: [Freshteam isn't just an ATS—it includes basic HRIS functionality](https://www.freshworks.com/hrms/features/). Employee directory, time-off tracking, onboarding.

**Modern interface**: [Looks and feels like a modern SaaS product](https://www.g2.com/products/freshteam/reviews). Clean, intuitive, pleasant to use.

**Mobile app**: [Recruiting on the go is easier with Freshteam's mobile app](https://www.freshworks.com/hrms/features/mobile-app).

**Candidate portal**: [Candidates can check application status, schedule interviews, and upload documents](https://www.freshworks.com/hrms/features/candidate-portal).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Free tier has limitations**: [No custom career site branding, limited interview scheduling, no background check integrations](https://www.capterra.com/p/155788/Freshteam/reviews). You get what you pay for.

**Support for free tier is limited**: [Email only, slower response times](https://www.trustradius.com/products/freshteam/reviews). Paid tiers get better support.

**Less specialized than pure ATS platforms**: [Freshteam tries to be HRIS + ATS](https://www.g2.com/products/freshteam/reviews). It's good at both but not best-in-class at either.

**Best for:** Very small businesses (under 50 employees) who want a free solution and are okay with limited features.

**Skip if:** You need branded career sites, advanced features, or priority customer support.

## Recruiterbox (by Trakstar): The Midpoint Option

[Recruiterbox is simple enough for small businesses but powerful enough to scale](https://www.recruiterbox.com/).

**Pricing:** Starts at $199/month (unlimited users). [Pricing increases based on active job postings, not users](https://www.recruiterbox.com/pricing).

**What it does well:**

**Unlimited users**: [Every tier includes unlimited users](https://www.recruiterbox.com/pricing). Great for small companies where multiple people recruit occasionally.

**Simple interface**: [Designed to be intuitive without training](https://www.g2.com/products/recruiterbox/reviews). Hiring managers can jump in and use it immediately.

**Candidate pipeline view**: [Visual pipeline makes it easy to see where every candidate is in the process](https://www.recruiterbox.com/features/pipeline-view).

**Interview scheduling**: [Integrated scheduling with Google Calendar and Outlook](https://www.recruiterbox.com/features/interview-scheduling).

**Mobile recruiting**: [Full-featured mobile app for recruiting on the go](https://www.recruiterbox.com/features/mobile).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Limited customization**: [You can't heavily customize workflows or interface](https://www.capterra.com/p/117371/Recruiterbox/reviews). What you see is what you get.

**Reporting is basic**: [Standard reports work, but you can't build complex custom reports](https://www.trustradius.com/products/recruiterbox/reviews).

**Job posting limits**: [Higher tiers are needed if you have lots of open roles simultaneously](https://www.recruiterbox.com/pricing).

**Best for:** Small businesses that want something between "very basic" and "enterprise complex."

**Skip if:** You need deep customization or have very limited budget (under $200/month).

## The "Just Use Greenhouse/Lever On Their Small Business Tier" Argument

[Greenhouse and Lever both offer small business pricing tiers](https://www.greenhouse.com/pricing). Should you consider them?

**Greenhouse Essentials:** Starts around $6,500/year. [Scaled-down version of enterprise Greenhouse](https://www.greenhouse.com/essentials).

**Lever Basic:** Similar pricing. [Fewer features than their enterprise tier](https://www.lever.co/pricing).

**Pros:**
- You're using the same platform big companies use
- Easier to scale as you grow
- Name recognition helps with candidates

**Cons:**
- Still expensive compared to Breezy ($189/month = $2,268/year vs. $6,500+/year)
- [More complex than most small businesses need](https://www.capterra.com/applicant-tracking-software/small-business-alternatives/)
- Implementation and setup still take time

**Verdict:** [If you're growing fast and expect to make 30+ hires in the next 12 months, consider it](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ats-for-growing-companies). If you're stable at 10-15 hires annually, stick with small business platforms.

## What About Google Sheets / Airtable?

[Some small businesses try to use spreadsheets or Airtable as a makeshift ATS](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/free_ats_alternatives/).

**Pros:**
- Free (or very cheap)
- Customizable
- Familiar tools

**Cons:**
- No compliance (EEOC data collection, record retention)
- No candidate experience (they email you resumes instead of applying through a portal)
- Manual everything (no job board posting, no resume parsing, no scheduling)
- [Doesn't scale](https://www.lever.co/blog/spreadsheet-recruiting-problems/)

**Verdict:** [Fine for 1-2 hires per year. Not viable for consistent hiring](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/when-to-adopt-ats-small-business).

## How To Choose The Right ATS For Your Small Business

Ask yourself:

**What's your budget?**
- $0: **Freshteam free tier**
- $75-$200/month: **Breezy HR**
- $200-$400/month: **JazzHR** or **Recruiterbox**
- $500+/month: Consider **Greenhouse/Lever** small business tiers

**How many hires per year?**
- 1-5 hires: **Freshteam free tier** or **Breezy HR**
- 5-15 hires: **Breezy HR** or **JazzHR**
- 15-30 hires: **JazzHR** or **Recruiterbox**
- 30+ hires: **Greenhouse/Lever** small business tier

**How tech-savvy is your team?**
- Not very: **Breezy HR** (simplest)
- Somewhat: **Freshteam** or **Recruiterbox**
- Very: **JazzHR** or **Greenhouse/Lever**

**Do you need HRIS features too?**
- Yes: **Freshteam** (includes basic HR management)
- No: **Breezy HR**, **JazzHR**, or **Recruiterbox**

## The Bottom Line

[Small businesses don't need enterprise ATS platforms](https://www.capterra.com/applicant-tracking-software/small-business/). You need something simple, affordable, and capable of handling 5-20 hires without overwhelming your team.

**Start with Breezy HR** if you have a modest budget ($189/month) and want something that works immediately.

**Try Freshteam** if your budget is $0 and you're willing to accept limitations.

**Upgrade to JazzHR** if you want more features and customization.

**Consider Greenhouse/Lever** only if you're growing fast and will outgrow small business platforms within a year.
