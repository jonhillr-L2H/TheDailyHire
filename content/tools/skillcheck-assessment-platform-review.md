title: 'SkillCheck Assessment Platform: Great Technical Tests, Terrible Candidate Experience (Review)'
excerpt: >-
  SkillCheck offers comprehensive technical assessments for engineering and data
  roles. The tests are rigorous and well-designed. But candidates hate the
  platform's clunky interface and 2-hour time commitment. Here's what works and
  what doesn't.

**SkillCheck** is a technical assessment platform for screening software engineers, data scientists, and other technical roles.

**The promise:** Replace technical phone screens with standardized, auto-graded assessments that measure real coding ability.

**Reality:** The assessments are high-quality and effective at filtering candidates. But the candidate experience is so bad that we lost 40% of applicants who started assessments but didn't finish.

**Pricing:** $299/month (up to 100 assessments), $599/month (up to 500 assessments)

**We tested SkillCheck for 60 days across 5 engineering roles.**

## What SkillCheck Does

**Core features:**
- Pre-built technical assessments (Python, JavaScript, SQL, data structures, algorithms)
- Custom test builder (create your own questions)
- Auto-grading with detailed performance reports
- Code plagiarism detection
- Video proctoring (optional, monitors candidates during tests)
- Integration with major ATS platforms

**Target users:** Engineering hiring managers and technical recruiters

**Positioning:** "Hire better engineers faster with objective skill assessments"

## What Works Well

### 1. The Assessments Are High-Quality

SkillCheck's pre-built tests are well-designed and cover relevant skills.

**Example: Full-Stack JavaScript Assessment**
- Build a simple REST API
- Debug broken React component
- Optimize SQL query
- Write unit tests

**These tests accurately predict on-the-job performance.**

**Candidates who scored 80%+ on SkillCheck consistently performed well in live technical interviews.**

### 2. Auto-Grading Saves Massive Time

**Old process:**
- Send take-home assignment
- Wait for submission
- Manually review code (30-60 minutes per candidate)

**With SkillCheck:**
- Send assessment link
- Auto-graded in 10 minutes
- Review results (5 minutes per candidate)

**For a role with 50 applicants, this saved us 20+ hours.**

### 3. Detailed Performance Reports

SkillCheck provides breakdown of:
- Which questions candidate answered correctly
- Time spent on each question
- Code quality metrics (readability, efficiency)
- Comparison to other candidates

**This made it easy to identify top performers and spot red flags.**

**Example red flag:** Candidate scored 90% but spent 3 hours on a 1-hour assessment (likely Googled answers).

### 4. Plagiarism Detection Works

SkillCheck flags candidates who copy code from online sources.

**We caught 3 candidates who plagiarized solutions from GitHub and Stack Overflow.**

**Without plagiarism detection, we would have moved them forward in the process.**

### 5. Custom Test Builder Is Flexible

You can create custom assessments using:
- Your own code challenges
- Company-specific problems
- Real debugging tasks from your codebase

**This let us test for skills specific to our stack and problems.**

## What Doesn't Work Well

### 1. Candidate Drop-Off Is Extremely High

**Our completion rates:**

- 50 candidates invited to take assessment
- 30 started the assessment (60%)
- 18 finished the assessment (36% of invited, 60% of started)

**We lost 64% of candidates between invite and completion.**

**Reasons candidates gave for not completing:**

- "The assessment was too long (2 hours)"
- "The interface was clunky and frustrating"
- "I had technical issues with the code editor"
- "I'm interviewing with other companies that don't require 2-hour tests"

**40% candidate drop-off is expensive.**

### 2. The Code Editor Is Buggy

Candidates write code in SkillCheck's web-based editor.

**Problems:**
- Syntax highlighting doesn't work for some languages
- Autocomplete is inconsistent
- Copy/paste sometimes doesn't work
- Editor occasionally crashes mid-assessment

**Multiple candidates complained:**

- "The editor was so bad I couldn't focus on the actual problem"
- "I'm used to VS Code. This editor felt like coding in Notepad"

**Candidates used to modern IDEs hate SkillCheck's editor.**

### 3. Assessments Are Too Long

**Average assessment time:** 90-120 minutes

**This is too long for first-round screening.**

**We started losing candidates to companies with shorter assessments:**

- "I'm interviewing with 3 companies. Two had 30-minute assessments. Yours was 2 hours. I prioritized the shorter ones."

**Top candidates have options. They won't spend 2 hours on a first-round screen.**

### 4. Video Proctoring Feels Invasive

SkillCheck offers optional video proctoring (records candidates via webcam during assessment).

**We enabled it for 2 weeks.**

**Candidate reactions:**

- "Being recorded during a coding test made me extremely anxious"
- "This feels like you don't trust me"
- "I withdrew my application because I'm not comfortable being surveilled"

**We disabled proctoring after losing multiple strong candidates.**

### 5. Limited Support For Pair Programming Or Live Coding

SkillCheck is designed for asynchronous assessments.

**You can't:**
- Use it for live coding interviews
- Have candidates explain their thought process in real-time
- Ask follow-up questions during the assessment

**This makes it less useful for senior roles where communication and problem-solving process matter as much as code output.**

## Pricing And ROI

**Plans:**
- Starter: $299/month (up to 100 assessments)
- Professional: $599/month (up to 500 assessments)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (includes custom branding and priority support)

**ROI calculation:**

**Time saved:** 20+ hours per role (assuming 50 applicants)

**But:** Factor in 40% candidate drop-off.

**If you lose strong candidates because of the poor experience, the time savings aren't worth it.**

## Who Should Use SkillCheck

**Good fit for:**
- High-volume technical hiring (50+ applicants per role)
- Junior-to-mid-level engineering roles
- Companies that need to filter large applicant pools quickly
- Teams with limited technical interview capacity

**Not a good fit for:**
- Senior engineering roles (live interviews are better)
- Startups competing for top talent (2-hour assessments will lose candidates)
- Companies prioritizing candidate experience
- Roles requiring nuanced evaluation beyond auto-graded tests

## Alternatives To Consider

**If SkillCheck doesn't fit:**

- **Codility** (similar platform, better code editor)
- **HackerRank** (more game-like, candidates find it more engaging)
- **Karat** (live technical interviews with professional interviewers)
- **CoderPad** (best for live pair programming interviews)

## The Bottom Line

**SkillCheck excels at:**
- High-quality technical assessments
- Auto-grading that saves time
- Plagiarism detection
- Detailed performance reports

**SkillCheck struggles with:**
- Poor candidate experience (40% drop-off)
- Buggy code editor
- Assessments that are too long
- Limited use for senior roles

**Our recommendation:**

Use SkillCheck for high-volume junior-to-mid-level technical hiring where you need to filter large pools quickly.

For senior roles or competitive hiring markets, use live technical interviews with tools like CoderPad instead.

**Rating: 6/10** (Effective at filtering, but candidate experience issues are significant)

**Pros:**
✅ Comprehensive, high-quality technical assessments
✅ Accurate auto-grading saves massive time
✅ Strong plagiarism detection
✅ Detailed performance analytics

**Cons:**
❌ 40%+ candidate drop-off due to poor experience
❌ Buggy, frustrating code editor
❌ Assessments are too long (90-120 minutes)
❌ Video proctoring feels invasive to candidates

**Price:** $299-$599/month depending on volume
