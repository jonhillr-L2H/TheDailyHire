You're interviewing a candidate. You're trying to listen, ask good questions, evaluate responses, and take detailed notes—all simultaneously.

[Interview intelligence platforms promise to solve this by recording interviews, transcribing them automatically, and using AI to surface insights](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-intelligence-platforms-2025). You focus on the conversation. The AI handles the documentation.

Some platforms deliver genuine value—better notes, faster feedback, more consistent evaluation. Others feel like Big Brother surveillance that makes candidates uncomfortable and provides minimal useful insight.

Here's which interview intelligence tools are worth using.

## What Interview Intelligence Platforms Actually Do

[These aren't just recording tools](https://www.lever.co/blog/interview-intelligence-platforms-overview/)—they're AI-powered analysis platforms:

**Record and transcribe**: Capture video/audio interviews and convert speech to searchable text automatically.

**Highlight key moments**: [AI flags important responses, red flags, or standout answers](https://www.brighthire.com/product).

**Generate summaries**: [Automatically create interview summaries and scorecards](https://www.metaview.ai/product/summaries).

**Track competencies**: [Map candidate responses to required skills and competencies](https://www.pillar.hr/product).

**Enable collaboration**: [Share clips and highlights with hiring teams instead of forwarding 45-minute recordings](https://www.brighthire.com/product/collaboration).

**Reduce bias**: [Standardize evaluation by focusing on what was actually said, not gut feel](https://www.metaview.ai/resources/reducing-bias).

## BrightHire: The Interview Intelligence Leader

[BrightHire is the most established interview intelligence platform](https://www.brighthire.com/).

**Pricing:** Custom enterprise pricing. Expect $5K-$20K+ annually depending on users.

**What it does well:**

**Seamless recording**: [Integrates with Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams](https://www.brighthire.com/product/integrations). One click to record and transcribe interviews automatically.

**AI-generated highlights**: [Flags key moments, strong/weak answers, and red flags](https://www.brighthire.com/product/highlights). Saves time reviewing recordings.

**Interview guides**: [Provides structured interview questions and tracks whether you asked them](https://www.brighthire.com/product/interview-guides). Improves consistency.

**Collaboration features**: [Share specific clips with hiring managers instead of making them watch full interviews](https://www.brighthire.com/product/collaboration).

**ATS integration**: [Syncs with Greenhouse, Lever, and other major platforms](https://www.brighthire.com/product/integrations). Interview notes automatically flow into your ATS.

**Coaching**: [Provides feedback to interviewers on question quality, talk time, and bias indicators](https://www.brighthire.com/product/coaching).

**Candidate consent handled**: [BrightHire handles disclosure and consent requirements properly](https://www.brighthire.com/resources/candidate-consent).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Expensive**: [Enterprise pricing means small companies can't afford it](https://www.g2.com/products/brighthire/reviews).

**Requires candidate consent**: [Some candidates decline to be recorded, which limits usefulness](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/brighthire_candidate_refusals/). (This is a legal requirement, not a platform limitation.)

**AI highlights can be hit or miss**: [Sometimes flags irrelevant moments or misses important ones](https://www.capterra.com/p/249863/BrightHire/reviews).

**Best for:** Enterprise recruiting teams doing high-volume hiring who want structured, consistent interviews.

**Skip if:** You're a small company, do low-volume hiring, or candidates frequently decline recording consent.

## Metaview: The AI Note-Taking Focus

[Metaview emphasizes AI-generated interview notes and summaries over full recordings](https://www.metaview.ai/).

**Pricing:** Starts around $30-$50 per user/month. More affordable than BrightHire.

**What it does well:**

**Excellent AI summaries**: [Metaview's AI-generated interview notes are comprehensive and accurate](https://www.metaview.ai/product/summaries). Better than most human notes.

**Fast**: [Notes appear within minutes of interview completion](https://www.g2.com/products/metaview/reviews). No waiting hours for transcription.

**Scorecard automation**: [Automatically populates interview scorecards based on responses](https://www.metaview.ai/product/scorecards).

**Accessible pricing**: [Significantly cheaper than BrightHire](https://www.metaview.ai/pricing), accessible for mid-size companies.

**ATS integration**: [Works with major ATS platforms](https://www.metaview.ai/integrations).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Less emphasis on collaboration**: [Metaview focuses on notes, not clip-sharing](https://www.capterra.com/p/10037582/Metaview/reviews). If you want to share video moments, BrightHire is better.

**Newer platform**: [Less established than BrightHire, smaller customer base](https://www.trustradius.com/products/metaview/reviews).

**Limited interviewer coaching**: [Doesn't provide as much feedback to interviewers on their technique](https://www.g2.com/products/metaview/reviews).

**Best for:** Mid-size companies that want AI note-taking and summaries without enterprise pricing.

**Skip if:** You want extensive collaboration features or interviewer coaching.

## Pillar: The Candidate-Focused Platform

[Pillar positions itself as candidate-friendly interview intelligence](https://www.pillar.hr/).

**Pricing:** Custom pricing. Mid-range between Metaview and BrightHire.

**What it does well:**

**Transparent candidate experience**: [Candidates can access their own interview recordings and transcripts](https://www.pillar.hr/product/candidate-experience). Reduces "what did I say?" anxiety.

**Skills-based evaluation**: [Maps responses to competencies and skills](https://www.pillar.hr/product/skills-assessment). Helps with structured hiring.

**Interview prep for candidates**: [Candidates can practice with Pillar before real interviews](https://www.pillar.hr/product/interview-prep). Improves candidate readiness.

**Bias reduction focus**: [Structured evaluation and transparent criteria reduce subjective bias](https://www.pillar.hr/product/diversity).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Less AI sophistication**: [AI features aren't as advanced as BrightHire or Metaview](https://www.g2.com/products/pillar/reviews).

**Smaller feature set**: [Focuses on core use cases, doesn't have as many bells and whistles](https://www.capterra.com/p/10033949/Pillar/reviews).

**Candidate access creates risk**: [Giving candidates their recordings could create legal exposure if handled poorly](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/interview_recording_candidate_access/).

**Best for:** Companies prioritizing candidate experience and bias reduction.

**Skip if:** You want cutting-edge AI features or comprehensive collaboration tools.

## Interviewer.AI: The Async Video Interview Platform With Intelligence

[Interviewer.AI combines asynchronous video interviews with AI analysis](https://www.interviewer.ai/).

**Pricing:** Starts around $200/month for small teams.

**What it does well:**

**Async interviews**: [Candidates record responses to questions on their own time](https://www.interviewer.ai/features/video-interviews). You review later.

**AI screening**: [AI analyzes responses and ranks candidates](https://www.interviewer.ai/features/ai-screening). Filters out weak candidates before human review.

**Time savings**: [No scheduling needed—candidates complete interviews when convenient](https://www.interviewer.ai/features/scheduling-free).

**Affordable**: [Cheaper than live interview intelligence platforms](https://www.interviewer.ai/pricing).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Not for live interviews**: [This is async only](https://www.g2.com/products/interviewer-ai/reviews). If you do live interviews, this doesn't help.

**AI screening raises bias concerns**: [Automated screening of video interviews can perpetuate bias](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ai-video-interview-bias-concerns).

**Candidate experience can be poor**: [Some candidates dislike talking to a camera with no interaction](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/async-video-interview-candidate-reactions/).

**Best for:** High-volume screening where you want to filter candidates before live interviews.

**Skip if:** You do primarily live interviews or have concerns about AI bias in video screening.

## What About Just Using Zoom/Google Meet Recording?

[You can record interviews without specialized platforms](https://www.zoom.us/recording). Should you?

**Pros:**
- Free (or included in your existing video platform subscription)
- No additional tools to manage
- Simple

**Cons:**
- No AI summaries or highlights
- [Manual transcription required](https://otter.ai/) (or pay separately for transcription)
- No ATS integration
- [Compliance and consent handling is on you](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-recording-legal-compliance)
- No collaboration features
- Harder to search or review specific moments

**Verdict:** [Fine for occasional use or very small companies](https://www.lever.co/blog/interview-recording-diy-vs-platforms/). Not scalable or efficient for regular hiring.

## The Legal and Ethical Considerations

[Recording interviews creates legal obligations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-recording-laws-2025):

**Consent required**: [Most states require one-party or all-party consent](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations). Interview intelligence platforms handle disclosure, but verify they're doing it properly.

**Candidate refusals**: [Some candidates will decline to be recorded](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/candidate-recording-consent-refusal-rates/). You can't force them. Have a plan for how to handle non-recorded interviews.

**Data retention**: [Recordings are employment records subject to retention and deletion requirements](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-recording-retention-policies).

**Bias risk**: [If your AI is flagging responses in biased ways, you're creating legal exposure](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/employment-tests-and-selection-procedures). Monitor for adverse impact.

**Candidate discomfort**: [Being recorded can make candidates nervous and perform worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/interview_recording_anxiety/). Factor that into evaluation.

## Interview Intelligence Best Practices

**Be transparent**: [Tell candidates upfront that interviews will be recorded and why](https://www.lever.co/blog/interview-recording-candidate-communication/). "This helps us take better notes and make fairer decisions."

**Make it optional**: [Offer non-recorded interview options for candidates who decline](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-recording-opt-out-procedures).

**Use AI as a tool, not a decision-maker**: [AI can highlight moments and suggest scores, but humans make final decisions](https://www.hrdive.com/news/ai-interview-tools-human-judgment/701234/).

**Train interviewers**: [Recording doesn't fix bad interview questions or techniques](https://www.brighthire.com/resources/interviewer-training). You still need skilled interviewers.

**Don't rely solely on recordings**: [Watch for non-verbal cues during live interviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/interview-non-verbal-communication/). AI can't capture everything.

**Review for bias**: [Monitor whether AI highlights correlate with protected characteristics](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/employment-tests-and-selection-procedures). If they do, fix or stop using the tool.

## How To Choose The Right Platform

**For enterprise teams with budget:** **BrightHire** (most comprehensive)

**For mid-size teams wanting AI notes:** **Metaview** (best AI summaries)

**For candidate experience focus:** **Pillar** (transparency and prep tools)

**For async screening:** **Interviewer.AI** (automated screening)

**For very small companies:** [Use Zoom/Meet recording + Otter.ai for transcription](https://otter.ai/) (affordable DIY approach)

**For companies with consent concerns:** Consider whether interview intelligence is worth the risk of candidates declining recording

## The Bottom Line

[Interview intelligence platforms work best when they help you have better conversations, not replace human judgment](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-intelligence-best-practices-2025).

**Use them to:**
- Document interviews more accurately
- Share key moments with hiring teams
- Reduce note-taking burden during interviews
- Improve interview consistency
- Coach interviewers on technique

**Don't use them to:**
- Fully automate candidate evaluation
- Replace live interviews with AI screening
- Make hiring decisions based solely on AI scores
- Record interviews without proper consent

[The best interview intelligence platforms make recruiting better without making candidates feel like they're under surveillance](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/interview-recording-candidate-trust/).

Choose platforms that respect candidates, handle consent properly, and enhance rather than replace human judgment.
