Your ATS is built for people who applied to jobs. [A recruitment CRM is built for everyone else—passive candidates, prospects, referrals, and future talent you want to keep warm](https://www.workable.com/blog/recruitment-crm). If you're only using an ATS, you're missing half your potential talent pool.

The question isn't whether you need a recruitment CRM. It's which one actually helps you build and maintain relationships at scale. Let's break down the major players.

## What A Recruitment CRM Actually Does

Before comparing tools, understand what problem they solve:

**Your ATS tracks active applicants** who came to you. [A recruitment CRM manages passive candidates you're pursuing](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruitment-crm-vs-ats/).

**Your ATS is transactional**: Application → Interview → Offer. Done.

**A CRM is relational**: [First contact → Nurture → Stay warm → Reach out when timing is right](https://www.greenhouse.com/blog/recruitment-crm).

Think of it this way: your ATS is for filling today's roles. Your CRM is for filling next quarter's roles with people you've been cultivating for months.

[The best recruiting teams use both](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ats-vs-crm-recruiting-2025).

## The Major Recruitment CRM Platforms

### Gem: The Passive Sourcing Powerhouse

[Gem is built specifically for outbound recruiting and relationship management](https://www.gem.com/). It's not trying to be an ATS—it's pure CRM.

**What it does well:**

**Chrome extension for LinkedIn**: Save profiles directly from LinkedIn to Gem with one click. Tag them, add notes, drop them into nurture campaigns.

**Email sequencing**: [Automated email campaigns that feel personalized](https://www.gem.com/features/email-campaigns). A/B testing, tracking, and follow-ups without manual work.

**Pipeline visualization**: [See exactly where every candidate is in your relationship-building process](https://www.gem.com/features/pipeline-management). Who needs follow-up, who's warm, who's cooling off.

**Analytics that matter**: [Track response rates, engagement, and conversion from prospect to applicant](https://www.gem.com/product/analytics). Know what's working.

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Pricing**: Gem is expensive. [Expect $10K-$30K+ annually depending on seats](https://www.getapp.com/recruitment-software/a/gem/pricing/). Not friendly for small teams.

**Learning curve**: [Lots of features means complexity](https://www.capterra.com/p/185331/Gem/reviews/). You'll need time to ramp up.

**Limited ATS integration**: Gem integrates with major ATS platforms, but [if you want a truly unified system, you might feel the friction between tools](https://www.g2.com/products/gem/reviews).

**Best for**: High-volume technical recruiting teams that live on LinkedIn and need sophisticated outbound campaigns.

**Skip if**: You're a small team or don't have budget for premium tools.

### Beamery: The Enterprise Talent Operating System

[Beamery positions itself as a "talent operating system" that combines CRM, marketing automation, and AI-powered matching](https://www.beamery.com/).

**What it does well:**

**AI-powered candidate matching**: [Beamery's AI analyzes your talent pool and surfaces the best candidates for new roles automatically](https://www.beamery.com/platform/ai-talent-matching). You're not manually searching—it's recommending.

**Marketing automation**: [Build complex nurture campaigns with triggers, segmentation, and personalization at scale](https://www.beamery.com/platform/marketing-automation). Think HubSpot, but for candidates.

**Internal mobility**: [Beamery handles both external recruiting and internal talent movement](https://www.beamery.com/solutions/internal-mobility). One platform for sourcing and internal hiring.

**Diversity and inclusion features**: [Built-in tools for building diverse talent pools and tracking D&I metrics](https://www.beamery.com/solutions/diversity-inclusion).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Enterprise-only pricing**: [Beamery is built for large organizations](https://www.trustradius.com/products/beamery/reviews). If you're not hiring hundreds of people annually, you can't afford it.

**Complexity**: This is a powerful platform, [which means it's complicated](https://www.g2.com/products/beamery/reviews). Expect months of implementation.

**Overkill for simple use cases**: If you just want to track passive candidates and send follow-up emails, Beamery is like buying a semi-truck to drive to the grocery store.

**Best for**: Enterprise recruiting teams with complex workflows, internal mobility programs, and dedicated recruiting ops resources.

**Skip if**: You're not enterprise-scale or need something simple and fast.

### Loxo: The All-In-One ATS + CRM

[Loxo combines ATS and CRM into one platform](https://www.loxo.co/), which is both its biggest strength and potential weakness.

**What it does well:**

**Unified system**: [You don't need separate tools for applicants and prospects](https://www.loxo.co/features/unified-platform). Everything lives in one place.

**AI sourcing**: [Loxo's AI searches multiple databases and suggests candidates automatically](https://www.loxo.co/features/ai-sourcing). Less manual sourcing work.

**Built-in contact data**: [Loxo includes contact information (emails, phone numbers) for millions of candidates](https://www.loxo.co/features/contact-database). You're not paying separately for sourcing tools.

**Automation everywhere**: [Email campaigns, follow-ups, task reminders, and pipeline management are all automated](https://www.loxo.co/features/automation).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Jack of all trades, master of none**: [Loxo tries to do everything, which means it's not best-in-class at any one thing](https://www.capterra.com/p/207698/Loxo/reviews/).

**Contact data quality**: [The built-in contact database is convenient but not always accurate](https://www.g2.com/products/loxo/reviews). Expect bounced emails.

**UI/UX can feel clunky**: [Some users report the interface isn't as intuitive as standalone CRMs](https://www.trustradius.com/products/loxo/reviews).

**Best for**: Recruiting agencies or small-to-mid-size in-house teams that want one platform instead of juggling multiple tools.

**Skip if**: You already have an ATS you love and just need a best-in-class CRM to complement it.

### Clockwork: The Recruiter's Personal Assistant

[Clockwork is a lightweight CRM that integrates directly with Gmail and LinkedIn](https://www.clockworkrecruiting.com/), focusing on simplicity over features.

**What it does well:**

**Simplicity**: [Clockwork doesn't try to do everything. It helps you track candidates and automate follow-ups. That's it](https://www.clockworkrecruiting.com/features).

**Gmail integration**: [Works inside Gmail so you're not switching between tools](https://www.clockworkrecruiting.com/features/gmail-integration). Emails, reminders, and notes all live in your inbox.

**Affordable**: [Pricing starts around $50/month per user](https://www.clockworkrecruiting.com/pricing), making it accessible for small teams and solo recruiters.

**Fast setup**: [You can be up and running in under an hour](https://www.g2.com/products/clockwork-recruiting/reviews). No lengthy implementation.

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Limited advanced features**: [No AI matching, no complex campaigns, no advanced analytics](https://www.capterra.com/p/167890/Clockwork/reviews). It's basic by design.

**Doesn't replace an ATS**: [Clockwork is purely for candidate relationship management](https://www.clockworkrecruiting.com/). You still need an ATS for applicants.

**Scaling challenges**: [Works great for solo recruiters or small teams, but larger organizations will outgrow it quickly](https://www.trustradius.com/products/clockwork-recruiting/reviews).

**Best for**: Solo recruiters, small teams, or agencies that need simple, affordable CRM functionality without complexity.

**Skip if**: You need enterprise features, advanced automation, or plan to scale significantly.

### HireEZ (formerly Hiretual): The AI-Powered Sourcing CRM

[HireEZ combines AI sourcing with CRM functionality](https://www.hireez.com/), focusing on finding passive candidates and managing outreach.

**What it does well:**

**AI sourcing across platforms**: [HireEZ searches LinkedIn, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and 45+ other platforms simultaneously](https://www.hireez.com/features/ai-sourcing). Massive reach.

**Candidate rediscovery**: [The AI resurfaces past candidates from your database who match new roles](https://www.hireez.com/features/candidate-rediscovery). You're not starting from scratch every search.

**Diversity sourcing**: [Built-in filters and features specifically for building diverse candidate pools](https://www.hireez.com/solutions/diversity-hiring).

**Chrome extension**: [Save candidates from any website directly into HireEZ](https://www.hireez.com/features/chrome-extension). Works everywhere, not just LinkedIn.

**What it doesn't do well:**

**CRM features are secondary**: [HireEZ is primarily a sourcing tool with CRM functionality bolted on](https://www.g2.com/products/hireez/reviews). If you want deep relationship management, dedicated CRMs are better.

**Contact data quality varies**: [Like most sourcing tools, contact information accuracy is hit-or-miss](https://www.capterra.com/p/197854/HireEZ/reviews).

**Pricing complexity**: [Pricing isn't transparent and varies significantly based on features and seats](https://www.trustradius.com/products/hireez/reviews).

**Best for**: Recruiters who spend most of their time sourcing and want CRM features as a secondary benefit.

**Skip if**: Relationship management is your primary need and sourcing is secondary.

## How To Choose The Right CRM For Your Team

Ask yourself these questions:

**What's your primary use case?**
- If it's outbound recruiting and LinkedIn sourcing: **Gem**
- If it's enterprise-scale talent marketing: **Beamery**
- If you want one platform for everything: **Loxo**
- If you need simple, affordable, fast: **Clockwork**
- If sourcing is the priority: **HireEZ**

**What's your budget?**
- Under $100/month per user: **Clockwork**
- $200-$500/month per user: **Loxo, HireEZ**
- $500-$1000+/month per user: **Gem, Beamery**

**What's your team size?**
- Solo or small team (1-5 recruiters): **Clockwork, Loxo**
- Mid-size team (5-20 recruiters): **Gem, HireEZ, Loxo**
- Enterprise (20+ recruiters): **Beamery, Gem**

**Do you already have an ATS you love?**
- Yes, just need CRM: **Gem, Clockwork, HireEZ**
- No, want all-in-one: **Loxo, Beamery**

## The Bottom Line

[If you're serious about building talent pipelines and not just reacting to applicants, you need a recruitment CRM](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruitment-crm-guide/). The right choice depends on your team size, budget, and primary use case.

**For most teams**: Start with **Loxo** if you want all-in-one simplicity, or **Gem** if you have budget and focus on outbound recruiting.

**For small teams/solo recruiters**: **Clockwork** gives you 80% of the value at 20% of the cost.

**For enterprise organizations**: **Beamery** if you need the full talent operating system with internal mobility and advanced marketing automation.

Your ATS gets you applicants. A CRM gets you everyone else. Use both, or accept that you're only accessing half your talent pool.
