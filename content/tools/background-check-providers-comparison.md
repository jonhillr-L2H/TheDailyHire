You made an offer. The candidate accepted. Now you need a background check before they can start.

[The wrong background check provider turns this into a nightmare](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/background-check-provider-problems-2025): reports take three weeks, information is inaccurate, candidates get frustrated, and your start date gets pushed out indefinitely.

The right provider delivers accurate reports in 24-72 hours, handles adverse action properly, and doesn't make candidates want to quit before they start.

Here's how the major providers compare.

## What Actually Matters In A Background Check Provider

Before comparing platforms, understand what makes a good background check provider:

**Speed**: [Most candidates expect background checks to take 2-5 days, not two weeks](https://www.checkr.com/resources/background-check-turnaround-times). Slow checks delay start dates and lose candidates.

**Accuracy**: [Inaccurate background checks create legal liability and damage your hiring](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know). Wrong information means wrongful rejection or risky hires.

**Compliance**: [FCRA compliance isn't optional](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act). Providers must follow adverse action procedures correctly.

**Candidate experience**: [Confusing portals, excessive requests for information, and poor communication frustrate candidates](https://www.goodhire.com/resources/article/background-check-candidate-experience).

**Cost**: Background checks range from $30-$150+ per candidate depending on scope.

**Support**: When reports have issues or questions arise, you need responsive support.

## Checkr: The Modern, Fast, Tech-Friendly Option

[Checkr is the background check provider favored by tech companies and fast-moving startups](https://www.checkr.com/).

**Pricing:** Starts around $35-$50 per check for basic packages. Custom pricing for enterprise.

**What it does well:**

**Speed**: [Checkr averages 1-2 days for most background checks](https://www.checkr.com/product/screening-solutions). Some come back in hours. This is significantly faster than traditional providers.

**Modern interface**: [Clean, intuitive dashboard](https://www.checkr.com/product/platform). Candidates complete checks via mobile-friendly portal. No PDFs or faxing required.

**API and integrations**: [Seamless integration with major ATS platforms—Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.](https://www.checkr.com/product/integrations) Initiates checks automatically when offers are accepted.

**Compliance automation**: [Checkr handles FCRA adverse action procedures automatically](https://www.checkr.com/product/compliance)—pre-adverse letters, waiting periods, final adverse letters. Reduces legal risk.

**Transparent pricing**: [Clear pricing on the website](https://www.checkr.com/pricing). No "contact sales for pricing" BS.

**Candidate experience**: [Simple process, mobile-friendly, clear communication](https://www.g2.com/products/checkr/reviews). Candidates don't hate it.

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Can be more expensive than traditional providers**: [For basic checks, legacy providers might be $5-10 cheaper per check](https://www.capterra.com/p/165889/Checkr/reviews). At scale, that adds up.

**Occasional false positives**: [Like all providers, Checkr sometimes flags records that don't belong to the candidate](https://www.trustradius.com/products/checkr/reviews). They're good at resolving disputes, but it still causes delays.

**Limited international checks**: [Checkr primarily focuses on US checks](https://www.checkr.com/solutions/international). International background checks require different providers or add-ons.

**Best for:** Tech companies, startups, and any employer that values speed, modern UX, and API integration.

**Skip if:** You're doing high-volume, cost-sensitive hiring where $5 per check matters, or you need extensive international background checks.

## HireRight: The Enterprise Standard

[HireRight is one of the largest background check providers, serving major corporations globally](https://www.hireright.com/).

**Pricing:** Custom enterprise pricing. Expect$40-$100+ per check depending on package.

**What it does well:**

**Comprehensive services**: [Background checks, drug screening, I-9 verification, health screenings—all in one platform](https://www.hireright.com/our-services).

**Global coverage**: [HireRight handles international background checks in 200+ countries](https://www.hireright.com/solutions/global-screening). If you're hiring globally, this matters.

**Compliance expertise**: [Deep knowledge of FCRA, ban-the-box laws, and international screening regulations](https://www.hireright.com/resources/compliance).

**Enterprise features**: [Dedicated account management, custom reporting, SLA guarantees](https://www.hireright.com/why-hireright).

**Name recognition**: Candidates have heard of HireRight. [That familiarity reduces friction](https://www.g2.com/products/hireright/reviews).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Slow compared to modern providers**: [Average turnaround 5-7 days, sometimes longer](https://www.capterra.com/p/64851/HireRight/reviews). Not terrible, but not fast.

**Clunky interface**: [The platform feels dated compared to Checkr or GoodHire](https://www.trustradius.com/products/hireright/reviews). It works, but it's not modern or pleasant.

**Expensive**: [HireRight is premium-priced](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/hireright_pricing/). You're paying for name recognition and enterprise features.

**Customer support can be hit or miss**: [Some clients report excellent account management, others struggle to get responses](https://www.g2.com/products/hireright/reviews).

**Best for:** Large enterprises hiring globally who need comprehensive services and dedicated support.

**Skip if:** You're a small company, need fast turnaround, or care about modern UX.

## GoodHire: The Midmarket Sweet Spot

[GoodHire targets mid-size companies that want modern features without enterprise pricing](https://www.goodhire.com/).

**Pricing:** Starts around $30-$40 per check. Transparent pricing tiers.

**What it does well:**

**Balanced speed and cost**: [Average 1-3 day turnaround](https://www.goodhire.com/why-goodhire), faster than HireRight, priced lower than Checkr in many cases.

**Compliance focus**: [GoodHire emphasizes FCRA compliance and ban-the-box adherence](https://www.goodhire.com/compliance). Automated adverse action handling reduces legal risk.

**Modern but not bleeding-edge**: [Platform is contemporary, but not as sleek as Checkr](https://www.g2.com/products/goodhire/reviews). Still significantly better than legacy providers.

**Good customer support**: [Responsive support team with knowledge of compliance issues](https://www.capterra.com/p/154297/GoodHire/reviews).

**Flexible packages**: [Easy to customize what's included in background checks](https://www.goodhire.com/product/background-checks). Not forced into one-size-fits-all packages.

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Not as fast as Checkr**: [1-3 days is good, but Checkr often delivers in under 24 hours](https://www.trustradius.com/products/goodhire/reviews).

**Smaller provider**: [Less name recognition than HireRight or Sterling](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/goodhire_reviews/). Some candidates haven't heard of them.

**International coverage is limited**: [Primarily US-focused](https://www.goodhire.com/solutions). International checks are possible but not their strength.

**Best for:** Mid-size companies (50-500 employees) that want modern features, good speed, and reasonable pricing.

**Skip if:** You need the absolute fastest turnaround (Checkr) or extensive global screening (HireRight).

## Sterling: The Other Enterprise Option

[Sterling competes directly with HireRight for enterprise clients](https://www.sterlingcheck.com/).

**Pricing:** Custom enterprise pricing, similar to HireRight.

**What it does well:**

**Global reach**: [Background checks in 240+ countries and territories](https://www.sterlingcheck.com/solutions/global/).

**Industry-specific solutions**: [Healthcare, education, financial services—specialized screening packages for regulated industries](https://www.sterlingcheck.com/solutions/by-industry/).

**Integration ecosystem**: [Connects with 100+ ATS and HCM platforms](https://www.sterlingcheck.com/technology/integrations/).

**Compliance and risk management**: [Strong focus on FCRA compliance, adverse action automation, and legal protection](https://www.sterlingcheck.com/why-sterling/compliance/).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Similar drawbacks to HireRight**: [Slower turnaround than modern providers, dated interface, enterprise pricing](https://www.capterra.com/p/104611/Sterling/reviews).

**Sales-heavy process**: [Getting pricing requires talking to sales](https://www.trustradius.com/products/sterling-infinicheck/reviews). Can't just sign up and start.

**Best for:** Enterprises in regulated industries (healthcare, finance, education) that need specialized compliance and global screening.

**Skip if:** You're small/mid-size, want fast turnaround, or prefer transparent pricing.

## Accurate Background: The Budget Option

[Accurate Background focuses on cost-effective screening for high-volume hiring](https://www.accurate.com/).

**Pricing:** Among the cheapest—$25-$35 for basic checks.

**What it does well:**

**Low cost**: [If you're hiring high-volume hourly workers, Accurate Background offers competitive pricing](https://www.accurate.com/pricing).

**Basic checks done well**: [Criminal, employment verification, education—the essentials work fine](https://www.accurate.com/background-check-services).

**Compliance included**: [FCRA compliance and adverse action handling are standard](https://www.accurate.com/compliance).

**What it doesn't do well:**

**Slower turnaround**: [4-7 days average](https://www.g2.com/products/accurate-background/reviews). Fine for hourly roles, not great for professional hires.

**Less modern interface**: [Platform is functional but not pretty](https://www.capterra.com/p/156732/Accurate-Background/reviews).

**Support is basic**: [You get support, but not premium service](https://www.trustradius.com/products/accurate-background/reviews).

**Best for:** High-volume hiring in retail, hospitality, warehousing where cost matters more than speed.

**Skip if:** You're hiring professional roles where fast turnaround and candidate experience matter.

## What About Drug Screening?

[Most background check providers offer drug screening as an add-on](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/drug-screening-employment-2025):

**Checkr**: Partners with Quest Diagnostics. [Integrated ordering but candidate schedules separately](https://www.checkr.com/solutions/drug-screening).

**HireRight**: [Own network of collection sites](https://www.hireright.com/our-services/drug-alcohol-testing). More integrated.

**GoodHire**: Partners with Quest. [Similar to Checkr](https://www.goodhire.com/product/drug-testing).

**Sterling**: [Own network + lab partnerships](https://www.sterlingcheck.com/solutions/drug-alcohol-screening/).

If drug screening is critical to your hiring, factor in:
- **Network coverage**: Can candidates easily find collection sites?
- **Turnaround time**: How quickly do results come back?
- **Integration**: Does it happen alongside background checks or separately?

## How To Choose The Right Provider

**If you need speed and modern UX:** **Checkr**

**If you're hiring globally:** **HireRight** or **Sterling**

**If you want balance of speed, cost, and features:** **GoodHire**

**If you're cost-sensitive with high-volume hiring:** **Accurate Background**

**If you're in regulated industries:** **Sterling** (industry-specific packages)

**If you have an existing HRIS/ATS:** Check which providers integrate natively. [Checkr and GoodHire have the most integrations](https://www.checkr.com/product/integrations).

## The Compliance Warning

[Background check compliance is serious](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know). Violations create legal liability. Make sure your provider:

✅ Provides FCRA-compliant authorization forms

✅ Handles pre-adverse and adverse action notices automatically

✅ Gives candidates opportunity to dispute inaccurate information

✅ Follows ban-the-box laws where applicable

✅ Provides proper record retention

[All the providers listed above handle compliance well](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/background-check-compliance-2025). Don't use random cheap providers that skip these steps.

## The Bottom Line

[Background checks are mandatory for most hiring but don't have to be painful](https://www.goodhire.com/resources/article/background-check-best-practices).

**For most companies:** Start with **Checkr** (speed + UX) or **GoodHire** (balanced).

**For enterprises:** **HireRight** or **Sterling** (global reach + enterprise features).

**For high-volume, cost-sensitive:** **Accurate Background**.

And whatever you do: [don't skip background checks or use non-compliant providers to save money](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/background-check-risks-2025). The legal risk isn't worth it.
