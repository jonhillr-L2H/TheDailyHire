Paycor is a payroll and HR platform that decided recruiting should be part of the package deal. It's the Swiss Army knife approach to HR tech—decent at everything, exceptional at nothing, and convenient if you're already using it for payroll.

## What You're Getting

[Paycor Recruiting](https://www.paycor.com/products/recruiting-software) is a module within their larger HRIS suite. You get applicant tracking, job posting distribution, interview scheduling, and candidate communication tools. It's all the basics you'd expect from an ATS, integrated with your existing employee data, payroll, and onboarding.

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/paycor-recruiting), the integration is the main selling point. When a candidate gets hired, their data flows directly into onboarding and payroll without manual transfers or duplicate data entry. For companies already using Paycor for HR, this is genuinely convenient.

Job postings can push to major job boards, though user reviews suggest the distribution isn't as comprehensive as dedicated platforms like ZipRecruiter or Indeed. The interview scheduling tools sync with Outlook and Google Calendar, which is table stakes in 2025 but still nice to have.

## The Good Stuff

If you're already a Paycor customer for payroll or HR, adding the recruiting module makes sense from a systems consolidation standpoint. One login, one vendor relationship, one support team to yell at when things break. That simplicity has value.

The reporting integrates HR metrics with recruiting metrics, so you can track things like time-to-productivity or first-year retention by hiring source. Reviews on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com) mention this as a differentiator—most standalone ATS platforms can't give you post-hire analytics because they don't have access to the data.

Pricing is bundled into your Paycor contract, which might be cheaper than paying for a separate best-of-breed ATS. Emphasis on "might" because Paycor's pricing model is about as transparent as a brick wall.

## The Not-So-Good Stuff

It's not built for recruiting teams who live and breathe sourcing and candidate engagement. If you're doing high-volume hiring or recruiting for specialized roles, this will feel limiting. The candidate search and filtering are basic, the sourcing tools are minimal, and the automation isn't as robust as dedicated ATS platforms.

User reviews consistently mention that the interface feels clunky and outdated. One G2 reviewer said it "looks like it was designed in 2012 and hasn't been updated since." That might be harsh, but the UI definitely isn't winning design awards.

Customer support is hit-or-miss according to reviews. Some users love their reps; others say getting help takes forever because Paycor's support team handles the entire HR suite, not just recruiting. When your ATS breaks during a hiring surge, "we'll get back to you in 48 hours" isn't ideal.

## Who Should Actually Use This

Paycor Recruiting makes sense for small to mid-sized companies with straightforward hiring needs who are already using Paycor for payroll/HR. If you're hiring 30-50 people a year in standard roles and you value simplicity over sophistication, it'll do the job.

It doesn't make sense for companies with dedicated TA teams, high-volume hiring, or complex recruiting workflows. And it definitely doesn't make sense if you're not already a Paycor customer—there are better standalone ATS options.

## The Verdict

Paycor Recruiting is the recruiting tool equivalent of the combo meal at a fast-food restaurant. It's convenient, it's bundled with other stuff you're already buying, and it's fine if you're not that picky. But if recruiting is a strategic priority and you need specialized tools, you'll outgrow this fast.

The integration with Paycor's HR suite is the real value. Everything else is just adequate. If "adequate and integrated" meets your needs, great. If you're looking for best-in-class recruiting tools, keep looking.

**Rating: 3/5 for existing Paycor customers, 2/5 for everyone else**
