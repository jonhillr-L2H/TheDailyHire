Video interviewing tools have a bad reputation, mostly because platforms like HireVue turned the hiring process into a dystopian AI evaluation that candidates despise. [Spark Hire](https://www.sparkhire.com/) takes a different approach: simple, human-centered video interviews without the creepy algorithm scoring.

Is it perfect? No. But it's one of the better options if you need video interviewing without destroying your candidate experience.

## What Spark Hire Actually Offers

[Spark Hire provides both one-way video interviews (candidates record responses on their schedule) and live video interviews (basically Zoom for hiring)](https://juicebox.ai/articles/top-8-video-interviewing-software-for-recruiters). The interface is straightforward, the candidate experience is decent, and it integrates with most major ATS platforms.

[They also have their own built-in ATS](https://www.sparkhire.com/products/ats/) if you don't already have one, though honestly their strength is the video piece, not the ATS functionality.

## Where It Works Well

**One-way interviews for screening.** [If you need to screen 50 candidates for a role and can't possibly do 50 phone screens, one-way video interviews save massive amounts of time](https://www.sparkhire.com/products/one-way-interviews/). Candidates record responses to your questions on their schedule, you watch on yours. It's asynchronous efficiency without requiring AI analysis.

**Better candidate experience than competitors.** [No weird facial recognition analysis, no algorithm scoring personalities, just candidates answering questions on video](https://www.g2.com/products/spark-hire/reviews). It still feels more human than HireVue-style platforms.

**Actually works on mobile.** [Candidates can complete interviews from their phones without technical disasters](https://www.sparkhire.com/candidate-experience/). For roles where your candidate pool might not have computer access during work hours, this matters.

**Live interviews are solid.** [The live interview feature works well—better than some companies' janky Zoom setups](https://www.sparkhire.com/products/live-interviews/). Recording, transcription, and team collaboration features are built in. It's purpose-built for hiring, unlike general video conferencing tools.

**Integration with ATS platforms.** [Spark Hire connects with Greenhouse, Workable, Lever, BambooHR, and most other ATS platforms](https://www.sparkhire.com/integrations/). You're not creating a disconnected silo—candidate data flows to your main system.

**Reasonable pricing.** [Plans start around $149/month, which is way cheaper than enterprise video interview platforms](https://www.sparkhire.com/pricing/). For small to mid-size companies, this is affordable without being cheap.

## Where It Falls Short

Let's talk about the problems:

**One-way interviews still feel impersonal.** Yeah, it's better than AI-scored interviews, but [talking to a camera instead of a human still creates distance](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-interview-candidate-experience). Some candidates hate this format regardless of the platform. It's better for candidate experience than HireVue, but that's a low bar.

**Limited advanced features.** [If you need sophisticated assessment tools, coding challenges, or complex evaluation rubrics, Spark Hire isn't built for that](https://juicebox.ai/articles/top-8-video-interviewing-software-for-recruiters). It's good at basic video interviews, not comprehensive assessment.

**Their ATS is meh.** [If you're considering using Spark Hire's built-in ATS instead of a standalone one, don't](https://www.g2.com/products/spark-hire/reviews?filters[review_sentiment]=critical). Stick with a real ATS and use Spark Hire just for video interviews. That's where their strength is.

**No AI magic.** [If you were hoping for AI to automatically screen candidates or surface the best ones, Spark Hire doesn't do that](https://www.sparkhire.com/). You still have to watch the videos and evaluate manually. For some people, that's a feature (preserves human judgment). For others, it's a limitation (doesn't save as much time).

**Video quality varies.** [Candidate video quality depends on their internet connection and equipment](https://www.g2.com/products/spark-hire/reviews). If they're recording on a crappy laptop with bad lighting, the video will reflect that. The platform can't fix hardware problems.

## How to Use It Without Ruining Candidate Experience

If you're going to use Spark Hire (or any video interview tool), here's how to not screw it up:

**Use it for initial screening only.** [One-way video interviews should be an early filter, not a replacement for real conversations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-interview-best-practices). You're checking communication skills and basic fit, not making hiring decisions.

**Ask relevant questions.** [Don't ask candidates to "tell me about a time you dealt with conflict" on a recorded video](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/interviewing/video-interview-questions). Ask questions specific to the role that actually need video responses—like explaining a technical concept or walking through their design process.

**Keep it short.** [Nobody wants to spend 45 minutes talking to a camera](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/one-way-interview-best-practices). Limit one-way interviews to 15-20 minutes max (4-5 questions). If you need more than that, do a live conversation.

**Tell candidates what to expect.** [Send clear instructions about the process, how long it takes, and what types of questions they'll answer](https://www.sparkhire.com/candidate-experience/). Surprises create anxiety. Preparation creates better responses.

**Watch videos promptly.** [Nothing pisses off candidates more than recording a video interview and then waiting two weeks to hear back](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/candidate-experience-response-time/). If you're using async video to save time, actually save time—review and respond quickly.

## Who Should Actually Use This

**Use Spark Hire if you:**
- Need to screen large numbers of candidates efficiently
- Want video interviewing without AI scoring and analysis
- Are doing high-volume hiring for similar roles
- Have remote hiring needs across time zones
- Want a straightforward tool without complex features you won't use

**Don't use Spark Hire if you:**
- Are hiring low volume (under 20 hires/year) where phone screens are manageable
- Need comprehensive assessment tools beyond basic video
- Want AI-powered candidate analysis (which you probably shouldn't want, but some people do)
- Can't commit to watching and responding to videos quickly

## The Alternatives

[**Zoom or Teams**](https://zoom.us/) - For live interviews, you might not need a specialized tool. Your existing video conferencing works fine if you're not doing one-way interviews.

[**Jobma**](https://www.jobma.com/) - Similar to Spark Hire with one-way and live options. [Also includes coding assessments if you need that](https://juicebox.ai/articles/top-8-video-interviewing-software-for-recruiters).

[**VidCruiter**](https://www.vidcruiter.com/) - [More enterprise-focused with additional assessment features](https://www.vidcruiter.com/video-interviewing-software/). Probably overkill for small companies.

[**Nothing**](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/do-you-need-video-interviewing) - Controversial take: [maybe you don't need video interview software at all](https://hbr.org/2024/11/do-video-interviews-improve-hiring). Phone screens + in-person (or Zoom) conversations might work fine for your volume.

## The Bottom Line

[Spark Hire is a solid, reasonably-priced video interview tool that doesn't do anything offensive to candidate experience](https://www.sparkhire.com/). It's not revolutionary, but it works and doesn't cost a fortune.

If you need video interviewing—particularly one-way interviews for screening—[Spark Hire is one of the better options available](https://juicebox.ai/articles/top-8-video-interviewing-software-for-recruiters). It won't transform your hiring process, but it'll make screening more efficient without making candidates hate you.

Just remember: [video interviews are a tool for efficiency, not a replacement for human connection](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/balancing-efficiency-and-connection). Use them strategically in your process, not as your entire process.

And if candidates consistently complain about your video interview process, the problem might not be the tool—it might be that you're using video interviews in situations where a normal conversation would work better. [Technology should enhance recruiting, not replace the human elements that make hiring actually work](https://hbr.org/2024/09/when-recruiting-technology-backfires).
