Rippling is the everything platform. HR, payroll, benefits, IT management, device provisioning, app management, and oh yeah, there's a recruiting module too. It's like if someone built an enterprise software suite and just kept adding features until someone told them to stop, except nobody ever did.

The recruiting piece is actually pretty capable. But here's the question: do you want your recruiting platform from an HR company, or do you want a dedicated recruiting tool? Depends how much you value integration versus best-in-class recruiting features.

## What the Recruiting Module Does

Rippling's recruiting module handles the basics: job postings, applicant tracking, interview scheduling, offer management. It's not revolutionary, but it's competent. The big selling point is integration with everything else in Rippling - hire someone and their profile automatically becomes their employee record, benefits enrollment starts, devices get provisioned, apps get assigned. It's genuinely smooth.

Reviews on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/rippling/reviews) and [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/166699/Rippling/) consistently praise this seamless handoff from candidate to employee. No re-entering data, no manual setup, no onboarding chaos. You make the offer in Rippling, they accept, and by day one everything's ready. That's actually impressive.

The interface is clean and modern. Doesn't look like it was designed in 2008, which automatically puts it ahead of about 40% of recruiting tools. Hiring managers can review candidates, leave feedback, and move people through stages without needing a training manual.

## The Actually Good Parts

The integration is the killer feature. Everything lives in one system - recruiting, HR, payroll, IT. This eliminates so many handoffs and data transfers that normally create errors and delays. [Capterra reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/166699/Rippling/) from companies using the full Rippling suite love this unified approach.

Onboarding automation is stellar. Offer accepted? Employee record created, paperwork sent, benefits enrollment opened, laptop ordered, apps provisioned, manager notified. All automatic. It's what happens when the recruiting tool actually talks to the HR and IT systems because they're all the same system.

Reporting across the employee lifecycle is powerful. You can track metrics from application to hire to retention to termination, all in one platform. Want to know if certain recruiting sources produce employees who stay longer? Rippling can tell you because it has all the data.

The mobile experience is solid. Hiring managers can review candidates and provide feedback from their phones without wanting to throw said phones into the ocean. That's a low bar, but many recruiting tools fail to clear it.

## The Not Great Parts

The recruiting features are good but not best-in-class. If you compare Rippling's recruiting module to a dedicated ATS like Greenhouse or Lever, it's going to fall short on advanced features, customization, and depth. It's designed to be good enough, not to be the ultimate recruiting tool.

The complexity is overwhelming. Rippling does so much that configuring and managing it requires significant admin overhead. Multiple [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/rippling/reviews) mention the learning curve and setup time. You need someone who understands the entire platform, not just the recruiting piece.

Pricing is opaque and can get expensive fast. Rippling's model is "buy the platform, add modules" which sounds great until you realize each module costs extra and the total price tag can be shocking. The value is there if you use everything, but if you mainly need recruiting with light HR features, you're probably overpaying.

Customer support is hit-or-miss according to reviews. Some people report excellent support, others complain about slow response times and getting bounced between different teams. When your entire HR/IT/recruiting infrastructure is in one platform, bad support is extra painful.

## Who Should Actually Use This

You're implementing or already using Rippling for HR and payroll, and want recruiting that integrates seamlessly? Makes total sense. Adding the recruiting module is way easier than trying to integrate a separate ATS.

You're a growing company (50-500 employees) that wants one platform for everything? Rippling's unified approach could be exactly what you need, assuming you can handle the complexity and cost.

You value integration and automation over having the absolute best recruiting features? The tradeoffs might be worth it for the seamless workflow.

## Who Should Look Elsewhere

You're primarily focused on recruiting and want best-in-class ATS features? Dedicated recruiting platforms will serve you better. Rippling's recruiting is good but not great.

You're a small company that just needs recruiting software? Rippling is overkill. You're paying for a massive platform when you need one specific tool.

You don't have admin resources to manage a complex integrated system? Rippling requires real investment in configuration and ongoing management. It's not a "set up and forget" tool.

## The Real Assessment

Rippling's recruiting module is like the vegetable side dish at a steakhouse - it's fine, it's fresh, it does the job, but nobody's going to the steakhouse specifically for the vegetables.

The value proposition is integration, not recruiting excellence. If you're all-in on Rippling for your entire HR/IT infrastructure, adding recruiting makes sense. If you're just looking for great recruiting software, there are better options.

It's competent, integrated, and convenient. Just don't expect it to replace a dedicated ATS if recruiting is your primary focus. Know what you're getting and decide if the tradeoffs work for your situation.

Check out detailed reviews on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/rippling/reviews) and [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/166699/Rippling/) before committing to the Rippling ecosystem. It's powerful, but make sure it's powerful in the ways you actually need.
