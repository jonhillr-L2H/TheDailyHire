# ClearCompany ATS Review: When Your Recruiting Tool Has an Identity Crisis

ClearCompany is one of those platforms that couldn't decide what it wanted to be when it grew up, so it just became everything. It's an ATS! It's performance management! It's employee engagement! It's probably making you breakfast tomorrow!

The question is: does trying to do everything mean you do nothing particularly well?

## What You're Actually Getting

ClearCompany started as an applicant tracking system but evolved into a full "Talent Management Platform" that covers recruiting, onboarding, performance reviews, employee engagement surveys, and probably your astrological chart. The idea is you can manage the entire employee lifecycle in one system instead of duct-taping together six different tools.

According to [G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/clearcompany/reviews), the ATS portion is solid but not groundbreaking. You get job posting distribution, candidate tracking, interview scheduling, and basic reporting. Nothing revolutionary, but it works.

The integration between recruiting and onboarding is actually useful - when you hire someone, they automatically flow into onboarding workflows without manual data entry. For companies tired of copying the same information between systems, this is legitimately valuable.

## The Good Stuff

For mid-sized companies (100-1000 employees) that need both recruiting and performance management, ClearCompany makes sense. You're getting multiple HR functions in one platform with one vendor relationship and one training process. The UI is relatively modern and doesn't look like it was designed in 2003, which is more than I can say for some ATS platforms.

[User reviews on Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/126987/ClearCompany/) praise the customer support, which apparently responds to issues instead of sending you to a knowledge base and praying you go away. Novel concept in the software world.

The reporting capabilities are decent - you can track recruiting metrics, performance data, and engagement scores all in one place. Whether you'll actually use all that data is another question, but at least it's available.

## The Parts That Suck

Here's the problem with platforms that do everything: they rarely do any one thing exceptionally well. If you want a best-in-class ATS, dedicated platforms like Greenhouse or Lever are better. If you want elite performance management, there are better options. ClearCompany is the Swiss Army knife of HR tech - convenient, but you wouldn't use it to actually build something.

Reports from users indicate the mobile experience is mediocre, which matters if your hiring managers refuse to open laptops. The career site builder is basic and probably won't impress candidates used to modern web experiences.

The biggest complaint? Pricing. ClearCompany charges per employee, not per user, which means the cost scales with your entire company size even though only your HR team uses most features. For smaller companies, this can get expensive fast compared to recruiting-only tools.

Also, implementation reportedly takes longer than simpler ATS platforms because you're setting up multiple modules. If you just need recruiting software next month, this might not be your fastest path.

## The Real Talk

ClearCompany works best for companies that genuinely need the full talent management suite and want to consolidate vendors. If you're only hiring 20 people a year and don't care about performance reviews or engagement surveys, you're paying for features you'll never use.

It's competent across the board but exceptional at nothing. Whether that's a feature or a bug depends on your priorities.

**Best for:** Mid-sized companies wanting integrated talent management
**Skip if:** You only need recruiting tools or want best-in-class ATS
**Pricing:** Per-employee pricing, starts around $5K+ annually
