[Calendly is the default interview scheduling tool](https://www.calendly.com). Everyone uses it. Recruiters, hiring managers, candidates—everyone's familiar with the "pick a time on my Calendly" workflow.

But Calendly isn't perfect. [It's expensive at scale, lacks advanced routing logic, and the candidate experience is generic](https://www.g2.com/products/calendly/reviews/limitations-complaints). [Several alternatives offer features specifically valuable for recruiting workflows](https://www.softwareadvice.com/scheduling/calendly-alternatives/).

Here's a comparison of the best Calendly alternatives for recruiters, what they do better, and which situations call for ditching Calendly.

## The Calendly Baseline

Before we compare alternatives, here's what Calendly offers:

[Calendly provides automated scheduling where candidates pick available times from your calendar](https://calendly.com/features). [Integrates with Google Calendar, Outlook, and Office 365](https://help.calendly.com/hc/en-us/articles/calendar-connection-instructions). [Supports multiple event types (phone screens, panel interviews, etc.)](https://help.calendly.com/hc/en-us/articles/event-types-overview). [Sends automated confirmations and reminders](https://help.calendly.com/hc/en-us/articles/email-notifications-overview).

**Pricing**: [Free for basic use. $10/user/month for Essentials. $16/user/month for Professional. $16+/user/month for Teams](https://calendly.com/pricing).

**What recruiters like**: [Candidates can schedule themselves without email back-and-forth](https://www.ere.net/calendly-recruiting-efficiency-gains-2025/). [Calendar integration works reliably](https://www.capterra.com/p/163915/Calendly/reviews/calendar-integration-reliability). [Simple setup and familiar interface](https://www.g2.com/products/calendly/reviews/ease-of-use-feedback).

**What recruiters complain about**: [Limited routing logic for team scheduling](https://www.g2.com/products/calendly/reviews/team-scheduling-limitations). [Generic scheduling pages that don't match employer branding](https://www.capterra.com/p/163915/Calendly/reviews/customization-limitations). [No way for candidates to suggest alternative times—it's take-it-or-leave-it](https://www.productboard.com/blog/calendly-limitations-customer-experience/). [Pricing adds up fast for recruiting teams](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/scheduling-tool-costs-recruiting-teams-2025).

## The Alternatives Worth Considering

### Chili Piper - Best For Complex Routing

[Chili Piper is built for revenue teams (sales, customer success) but works exceptionally well for recruiting](https://www.chilipiper.com).

**What makes it different:**

[Intelligent routing based on rules you define](https://www.chilipiper.com/features/routing). [You can route candidates to specific interviewers based on role, skills, location, or availability](https://www.chilipiper.com/product/instant-booker). [Supports round-robin distribution across recruiting teams](https://www.chilipiper.com/features/round-robin-routing).

[Calendar pooling for panel interviews](https://www.chilipiper.com/features/group-scheduling). [Find available times when 3-5 interviewers are all free—automatically](https://www.g2.com/products/chili-piper/reviews/panel-interview-scheduling). [This is brutal to coordinate manually, Chili Piper solves it](https://www.capterra.com/p/177849/Chili-Piper/reviews/group-scheduling-functionality).

[Form-to-calendar connection](https://www.chilipiper.com/features/form-to-calendar). [Candidates fill out application forms and immediately book interviews in one flow](https://www.ere.net/application-to-interview-scheduling-automation-2025/). [No delay between "we want to talk to you" and getting on the calendar](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/interview-scheduling-automation-candidate-experience-2025).

[CRM and ATS integrations](https://www.chilipiper.com/integrations). [Works with major platforms to sync candidate data](https://www.g2.com/products/chili-piper/reviews/integration-capabilities).

**Pricing**: [Starts at $15/user/month for basic functionality. $30+/user/month for advanced features. Custom enterprise pricing](https://www.chilipiper.com/pricing).

**Best for**: [Corporate recruiting teams scheduling high volumes with multiple interviewers](https://www.capterra.com/p/177849/Chili-Piper/reviews/corporate-recruiting-use-cases). [Companies that need sophisticated routing logic](https://www.ere.net/interview-scheduling-routing-automation-2025/). [Situations where panel interview coordination is a nightmare](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/panel-interview-scheduling-tools-2025).

**Not ideal for**: [Solo recruiters or very small teams who don't need complex routing](https://www.g2.com/products/chili-piper/reviews/small-team-fit-assessment). [Budget-conscious organizations—Chili Piper is more expensive than most alternatives](https://www.softwareadvice.com/scheduling/chili-piper-pricing-review/).

### YouCanBook.me - Best For Affordability

[YouCanBook.me provides Calendly-like functionality at half the price](https://youcanbook.me).

**What makes it different:**

[Significantly cheaper: $10/calendar/month for core features](https://youcanbook.me/pricing). [One calendar can handle unlimited event types](https://support.youcanbook.me/article/understanding-calendars-event-types). [For small recruiting teams this means $10-30/month total instead of $100-200+](https://www.capterra.com/p/132482/YouCanBook-me/reviews/pricing-value-comparison).

[Customizable booking pages that actually look good](https://youcanbook.me/features/customization). [Better branding options than Calendly's basic tier](https://www.g2.com/products/youcanbook-me/reviews/customization-vs-calendly). [Can match company branding without upgrading to expensive plans](https://support.youcanbook.me/article/booking-page-customization-guide).

[Question forms before scheduling](https://youcanbook.me/features/custom-questions). [Ask candidates screening questions before they book time](https://www.ere.net/interview-scheduling-pre-qualification-automation-2025/). [Helps filter out unqualified candidates before they take interview slots](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/scheduling-qualification-workflows-2025).

[Calendar integration with Google, Office 365, iCloud, and more](https://youcanbook.me/features/calendar-integrations). [Works reliably according to user reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/132482/YouCanBook-me/reviews/calendar-sync-reliability).

**Pricing**: [Free plan available with limitations. $10/calendar/month for standard features. $12/calendar/month for premium](https://youcanbook.me/pricing).

**Best for**: [Small recruiting teams and solo recruiters on tight budgets](https://www.capterra.com/p/132482/YouCanBook-me/reviews/small-business-recruiting-fit). [Startups and small companies that need professional scheduling without enterprise costs](https://www.g2.com/products/youcanbook-me/reviews/startup-use-cases). [Anyone who finds Calendly too expensive but needs similar functionality](https://www.softwareadvice.com/scheduling/youcanbook-me-vs-calendly-comparison/).

**Not ideal for**: [Large recruiting teams needing advanced routing and team coordination](https://www.g2.com/products/youcanbook-me/reviews/enterprise-limitations). [Organizations requiring deep integrations with multiple systems](https://www.capterra.com/p/132482/YouCanBook-me/reviews/integration-limitations).

### Cal.com - Best For Open-Source Flexibility

[Cal.com is an open-source scheduling platform](https://cal.com). [You can self-host it or use their cloud service](https://cal.com/pricing).

**What makes it different:**

[Open-source means complete customization](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com). [Developers can modify anything about how it works](https://cal.com/docs). [No feature limitations or vendor lock-in](https://www.g2.com/products/cal-com/reviews/open-source-advantages).

[Self-hosting option eliminates per-user costs](https://cal.com/self-hosting). [Companies with technical resources can run Cal.com on their infrastructure for free](https://www.capterra.com/p/2459814/Cal-com/reviews/self-hosting-experience). [Only pay for hosting costs, not per-seat licensing](https://cal.com/docs/self-hosting-guide).

[Transparent pricing even on cloud version](https://cal.com/pricing). [Free tier is generous. Paid plans start at $12/user/month](https://cal.com/pricing). [Compared to Calendly's limited free tier, Cal.com offers more at every price point](https://www.softwareadvice.com/scheduling/cal-com-vs-calendly-pricing/).

[Strong API and webhook support](https://cal.com/docs/api). [Integrates with custom recruiting workflows and homegrown ATS systems](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-tech-stack-integration-cal-com-2025/). [Flexibility that closed-source alternatives can't match](https://www.g2.com/products/cal-com/reviews/api-integration-capabilities).

[Privacy-focused](https://cal.com/privacy). [Data ownership and control matter to some organizations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/recruiting-data-privacy-tools-2025). [Cal.com's open-source model provides transparency](https://cal.com/blog/privacy-first-scheduling).

**Pricing**: [Free for basic use. $12/user/month for Pro. $15/user/month for Teams. Self-hosting is free (infrastructure costs only)](https://cal.com/pricing).

**Best for**: [Companies with technical teams that want full control](https://www.capterra.com/p/2459814/Cal-com/reviews/technical-team-use-cases). [Organizations concerned about data privacy and vendor lock-in](https://www.g2.com/products/cal-com/reviews/enterprise-security-use). [Recruiting operations that need custom integrations with proprietary systems](https://www.ere.net/custom-recruiting-tech-integration-strategies-2025/).

**Not ideal for**: [Non-technical teams without development resources](https://www.g2.com/products/cal-com/reviews/non-technical-user-experience). [Anyone who wants plug-and-play simplicity without setup complexity](https://www.capterra.com/p/2459814/Cal-com/reviews/setup-difficulty-feedback). [Cloud version works fine for these users but loses some of the open-source advantages](https://cal.com/blog/cloud-vs-self-hosted-comparison).

### SavvyCal - Best For Candidate Experience

[SavvyCal flips the scheduling dynamic to respect both parties' time](https://savvycal.com).

**What makes it different:**

[Overlay scheduling](https://savvycal.com/features/overlay). [Instead of forcing candidates to pick from your available slots, SavvyCal shows your availability overlaid on their calendar](https://savvycal.com/features/personalized-links). [Candidates can see their own schedule and your availability at the same time](https://www.g2.com/products/savvycal/reviews/overlay-scheduling-feature). [This is legitimately better UX than Calendly's "pick a time I've decided to offer you" approach](https://www.ere.net/candidate-centric-scheduling-tools-2025/).

[Ranked availability](https://savvycal.com/features/ranked-availability). [You can mark certain times as "preferred" so candidates know which slots work best for you](https://savvycal.com/blog/ranked-availability-explained). [They can still book less-preferred times if needed, but they see what's ideal](https://www.capterra.com/p/2354678/SavvyCal/reviews/scheduling-preference-features).

[Multiple duration options](https://savvycal.com/features/multiple-durations). [Offer 30-minute or 60-minute interview slots in the same booking link](https://www.g2.com/products/savvycal/reviews/multiple-duration-flexibility). [Candidates choose what works for them instead of you pre-deciding](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/flexible-interview-scheduling-candidate-experience-2025).

[Beautiful, minimal interface](https://savvycal.com/features/beautiful-booking-page). [User reviews consistently praise the design](https://www.g2.com/products/savvycal/reviews/interface-design-feedback). [Feels more respectful and less transactional than generic scheduling pages](https://www.ere.net/interview-scheduling-candidate-perception-2025/).

[Per-link customization](https://savvycal.com/features/personalized-links). [Different branding, messages, and options for different roles or candidates](https://savvycal.com/blog/personalization-recruiting-workflows). [Makes scheduling feel tailored instead of impersonal](https://www.capterra.com/p/2354678/SavvyCal/reviews/customization-recruiting-applications).

**Pricing**: [$12/user/month for basic plan. $20/user/month for premium](https://savvycal.com/pricing). [Free trial available](https://savvycal.com/try).

**Best for**: [Recruiting for competitive roles where candidate experience matters](https://www.ere.net/candidate-experience-competitive-hiring-2025/). [Executive search and senior-level recruiting where respect for candidates' time is important](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/executive-recruiting-scheduling-etiquette-2025). [Employer brand-conscious companies that want every touchpoint to feel thoughtful](https://www.hrdive.com/news/employer-branding-candidate-experience-tools/715234/).

**Not ideal for**: [High-volume, transactional recruiting where scheduling 100+ candidates per week means simplicity trumps design](https://www.g2.com/products/savvycal/reviews/high-volume-limitations). [Teams that need complex multi-person routing](https://www.capterra.com/p/2354678/SavvyCal/reviews/team-scheduling-functionality).

### Acuity Scheduling - Best For Service-Based Recruiting

[Acuity Scheduling (owned by Squarespace) is designed for service businesses but works for recruiting](https://acuityscheduling.com).

**What makes it different:**

[Payment collection built-in](https://acuityscheduling.com/features/payments). [Not relevant for most corporate recruiting but useful for contract recruiters and staffing agencies that charge consultation fees](https://www.capterra.com/p/131369/Acuity-Scheduling/reviews/recruiting-consulting-use-cases).

[Intake forms and waivers](https://acuityscheduling.com/features/forms). [Collect detailed information before interviews](https://support.acuityscheduling.com/hc/en-us/articles/intake-forms-guide). [More robust than simple "add a question" features in other tools](https://www.g2.com/products/acuity-scheduling/reviews/form-capabilities-comparison).

[Class and group scheduling](https://acuityscheduling.com/features/classes). [Useful for recruiting events, group interviews, or hiring workshops](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/group-interview-scheduling-tools-2025). [Calendly offers this but Acuity's implementation is better for larger groups](https://www.ere.net/group-recruiting-event-scheduling-comparison-2025/).

[Strong Squarespace integration if your careers site is on Squarespace](https://acuityscheduling.com/squarespace). [Native embedding, matching design, seamless experience](https://www.capterra.com/p/131369/Acuity-Scheduling/reviews/squarespace-integration-feedback).

**Pricing**: [$16/user/month for Emerging plan. $27/user/month for Growing plan. $49/user/month for Powerhouse plan](https://acuityscheduling.com/pricing).

**Best for**: [Recruiting agencies and contract recruiters charging for services](https://www.capterra.com/p/131369/Acuity-Scheduling/reviews/staffing-agency-use-cases). [Companies running group interview events or recruiting workshops](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-event-management-scheduling-tools-2025/). [Organizations with Squarespace careers sites wanting native integration](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/recruiting-website-scheduling-integration-2025).

**Not ideal for**: [Most corporate recruiting teams who don't need payment processing or service-business features](https://www.g2.com/products/acuity-scheduling/reviews/corporate-recruiting-fit). [It's more expensive than alternatives with similar core scheduling features](https://www.softwareadvice.com/scheduling/acuity-scheduling-pricing-comparison/).
