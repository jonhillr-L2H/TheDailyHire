**Calendly** is a scheduling tool that eliminates "when are you available?" email chains.

**How it works:** You share your Calendly link, candidates pick a time, it auto-books on both calendars.

**Many recruiting teams use Calendly for interview scheduling.**

**But Calendly isn't built specifically for recruiting.** It's a general-purpose scheduling tool.

**The question:** Is Calendly good enough for hiring, or do you need a recruiting-specific scheduling tool?

**Pricing:** Free (basic), $12/user/month (Professional), $16/user/month (Teams)

**We used Calendly for 90 days across 15 roles.**

## What Calendly Does

**Core features:**
- Share booking links (candidates pick available times)
- Auto-syncs with Google Calendar, Outlook, iCal
- Automatic email confirmations and reminders
- Zoom/Google Meet integration (auto-generates meeting links)
- Buffer times between meetings
- Team scheduling (round-robin or collective availability)

**Target users:** Anyone who schedules meetings (sales, customer success, recruiting, etc.)

**Positioning:** "Scheduling automation for everyone"

## What Works Well

### 1. Setup Takes 10 Minutes

**Setup process:**
1. Connect your calendar
2. Set your availability (e.g., Mon-Fri 9am-5pm)
3. Create an event type (e.g., "30-minute phone screen")
4. Share your link

**Done.**

**No training required. No complicated configuration.**

**Our team was up and running in under 15 minutes.**

### 2. Candidates Love The Experience

**Old process:**
- Recruiter: "Are you available Tuesday at 2pm?"
- Candidate: "No, but Wednesday at 3pm works."
- Recruiter: "Wednesday doesn't work for the hiring manager. How about Thursday at 1pm?"
- (This continues for 3-4 emails)

**With Calendly:**
- Recruiter sends link
- Candidate picks time
- Done in 60 seconds

**Candidate feedback:**
- "This was so much easier than the back-and-forth at other companies"
- "I appreciated being able to pick a time that worked for me"

**Candidates strongly prefer self-scheduling over email coordination.**

### 3. Reduces No-Shows With Automatic Reminders

Calendly sends automatic email reminders:
- 24 hours before interview
- 1 hour before interview

**Our no-show rate:**
- Before Calendly: 12% of candidates no-showed
- With Calendly: 4% no-show rate

**Automatic reminders significantly reduce no-shows.**

### 4. Buffer Times Prevent Back-To-Back Burnout

You can set buffer times:
- 15 minutes before interviews (prep time)
- 15 minutes after interviews (notes, breaks)

**This prevents interviewers from being booked for 8 straight hours of back-to-back interviews.**

**Our hiring managers appreciated this.**

### 5. Integrates With Zoom And Google Meet

Calendly auto-generates video meeting links when someone books.

**No more:**
- Forgetting to send the Zoom link
- Scrambling to create a meeting link 5 minutes before the interview
- Candidates emailing "where's the link?"

**Everything is automated.**

## What Doesn't Work Well

### 1. No Multi-Person Panel Scheduling

Calendly can check one person's availability.

**What it can't do:** Check availability for 3+ people simultaneously and find times that work for everyone.

**Example:**

You need to schedule a panel interview with:
- Hiring manager
- 2 engineers
- 1 recruiter

**With Calendly:**
- You have to manually check all 4 calendars
- Find overlapping availability
- Book manually

**Calendly's "collective availability" feature only works if everyone uses Calendly (most hiring teams don't).**

**For panel interviews, Calendly doesn't save time.**

### 2. No ATS Integration

Calendly doesn't integrate with applicant tracking systems (Greenhouse, Lever, Workable, etc.).

**This means:**
- Candidates book interviews via Calendly
- You manually copy interview details into your ATS
- You manually update candidate status in ATS after interviews

**For teams using an ATS (most teams), this creates extra manual work.**

**Recruiting-specific tools like GoodTime and Calendly's competitor Chili Piper integrate with ATS systems.**

### 3. Limited Interview Type Customization

**Calendly event types:**
- 15-minute call
- 30-minute phone screen
- 60-minute interview

**What you can't do:**
- Create multi-stage interview workflows
- Automatically send different links for different interview rounds
- Customize confirmation emails per role or interview stage

**Recruiting-specific tools offer more customization for hiring workflows.**

### 4. No Candidate Pipeline Visibility

Calendly tracks individual bookings but doesn't show:
- How many candidates have interviews scheduled this week
- Which roles have interview bottlenecks
- Recruiter performance (how many interviews each recruiter scheduled)

**For recruiting teams managing 10+ open roles, this lack of visibility is a problem.**

### 5. Round-Robin Scheduling Is Clunky

**Round-robin:** Distribute interviews evenly across a team of interviewers.

**Example:** You have 3 recruiters. You want phone screens distributed evenly.

**Calendly offers round-robin, but:**
- It's based on calendar availability, not workload balance
- If one recruiter has more availability, they get more interviews (not equal distribution)
- No way to set max interviews per day per recruiter

**Recruiting-specific tools have better round-robin logic.**

## Pricing And ROI

**Plans:**
- Free: 1 event type, unlimited bookings (good for single use case)
- Professional: $12/user/month (unlimited event types, integrations)
- Teams: $16/user/month (team scheduling, round-robin, admin controls)

**ROI:**

If you're scheduling 20+ interviews per month, Calendly pays for itself in time saved (2-3 hours/week).

**But:** If you need panel scheduling or ATS integration, you'll still be doing manual work.

## Who Should Use Calendly For Recruiting

**Good fit for:**
- Small teams (1-3 recruiters)
- Simple interview processes (mostly 1-on-1 phone screens)
- Teams not using an ATS (or using a very basic one)
- Budget-conscious teams ($12-16/user/month is affordable)

**Not a good fit for:**
- Panel interviews (multi-person scheduling doesn't work well)
- Teams using ATS systems (no integration)
- High-volume hiring (lacks pipeline visibility and analytics)
- Complex interview workflows (limited customization)

## Alternatives To Consider

**If Calendly doesn't fit:**

- **GoodTime** (recruiting-specific, ATS integration, panel scheduling)
- **Chili Piper** (similar to Calendly, better for sales and recruiting teams)
- **Modern Hire** (includes scheduling + video interviewing + assessments)
- **Your ATS's built-in scheduling** (Greenhouse and Lever have native scheduling)

## The Bottom Line

**Calendly works well for:**
- Simple 1-on-1 interview scheduling
- Eliminating email back-and-forth
- Reducing candidate no-shows
- Budget-friendly teams

**Calendly struggles with:**
- Panel interview coordination
- ATS integration
- Complex recruiting workflows
- Pipeline visibility and analytics

**Our recommendation:**

If you're a small team doing mostly 1-on-1 phone screens, Calendly is a great affordable option.

If you do panel interviews, use an ATS, or hire at high volume, invest in a recruiting-specific tool like GoodTime.
