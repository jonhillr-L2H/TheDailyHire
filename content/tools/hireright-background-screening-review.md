HireRight is one of the big names in background screening, handling millions of checks for enterprise companies every year. They're thorough, compliant, and slower than molasses in January.

If you need enterprise-grade background checks and don't mind candidates waiting 7-10 days for results, HireRight will get the job done. Just don't expect speed.

## What HireRight Offers

The full menu of background screening: criminal records, employment verification, education verification, credit checks, drug testing, global screening, and pretty much any other check you can think of.

Their compliance game is solid - they stay on top of FCRA regulations, ban-the-box laws, and state-specific requirements. For companies paranoid about compliance violations (which you should be), that's valuable.

They also handle adverse action letters and the dispute process, which saves HR teams from legal landmines. The platform guides you through the legally required steps when you find something disqualifying.

## The Good

Coverage is comprehensive - US and international, with local expertise in 200+ countries. If you're screening global candidates, HireRight can handle it without you cobbling together multiple vendors.

[G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/hireright/reviews) consistently mention accurate results and thorough checks. When HireRight comes back with a clear report, you can trust it. They're not cutting corners.

For enterprise customers, they offer dedicated support and custom packages. And their API integrations with major ATS platforms are solid - the candidate experience is relatively smooth when it's properly configured.

## The Bad

Speed is the big complaint. User reviews on [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/132495/HireRight/) are full of stories about checks taking 10-14 days when candidates were promised 3-5. International checks? Budget 3-4 weeks.

Customer support is hit-or-miss according to reviews. Enterprise customers with dedicated reps seem happy. Smaller customers using the standard support queue? Not so much. Expect slow response times and generic answers.

The candidate portal is functional but dated. It works, but it feels like software from 2015 because it probably is.

## The Pricing Headache

Like most enterprise vendors, pricing is "contact sales" territory. Expect per-check pricing that varies based on package (basic criminal check vs. comprehensive screening) and volume discounts if you're running thousands of checks.

Reports suggest $50-150 per check depending on what's included, with international checks costing significantly more. Not the cheapest option, but not outrageous for enterprise-grade screening.

## Compared to Competitors

HireRight sits alongside Sterling and Checkr as the major players. Sterling is similar in coverage and compliance (equally slow). Checkr is faster and more modern but with less international coverage.

If speed matters more than comprehensive global reach, Checkr might be better. If you need bulletproof compliance and global coverage, HireRight or Sterling are your options.

## The Verdict

HireRight is the safe, enterprise choice for background screening. They'll cover all compliance requirements, handle complex checks, and deliver accurate results. Eventually.

Set candidate expectations appropriately - tell them 7-10 days minimum, 14 days for international. And if you're evaluating vendors, ask for SLA guarantees on turnaround times because the default speed won't impress anyone.

**Rating: 3.5/5** - Reliable and thorough, but painfully slow. Enterprise-grade with enterprise-grade wait times.
