Let's cut through the noise: **Greenhouse was just ranked #1 in the G2 Winter 2025 Reports for Best Applicant Tracking System** across Mid-Market, Enterprise, AND EMEA categories. That's not a participation trophy. That's domination.

But rankings are one thing. What actually changed in 2025 that makes Greenhouse worth your attention (and budget)? Let me break it down.

## The Rankings Tell a Story

Before we dive into features, let's talk about what a **98% user satisfaction rate** actually means. That's not "pretty good." That's basically unanimous. When 93% of users rate a platform 4 or 5 stars, you're not looking at a tool people tolerate—you're looking at a tool people actively recommend.

[Greenhouse swept every major ATS category in G2's Winter 2025 analysis](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/greenhouse-ranked-best-ats-in-mid-market-enterprise-and-emea-in-g2-winter-2025-reports-302347153.html), beating out platforms with bigger marketing budgets and flashier sales pitches. That doesn't happen by accident.

## What's New in 2025: AI That Doesn't Suck

Every ATS vendor claims "AI-powered" everything. Greenhouse actually shipped features that matter:

### AI-Powered Candidate Summaries
No more reading through 12-page resumes to figure out if someone's qualified. The AI generates instant candidate summaries that highlight relevant experience, skills gaps, and potential fit. It's like having a research assistant who actually reads resumes instead of just pretending to.

### AI-Generated Interview Questions
Based on the role requirements and candidate background, Greenhouse now auto-generates interview questions that are actually relevant. Not generic "tell me about a time" questions you could ask anyone. Specific, role-tailored questions that help you evaluate what matters.

### AI Matching for Requisitions
This is where it gets interesting. Greenhouse's AI now surfaces candidates whose skills align with open requisitions across your entire database. That senior developer who applied six months ago for a different role? The system will flag them if they're a match for your current opening.

Translation: Your ATS is now proactively building your pipeline instead of passively storing resumes.

## The Features That Actually Matter

Let's talk about what separates Greenhouse from the 47 other ATS platforms that all claim to do the same thing:

### Native Interview Scheduling
No more Calendly integrations or back-and-forth email chains. Greenhouse now has self-service scheduling built directly into the platform. Candidates pick their time, it syncs with everyone's calendar, and interviews get scheduled without recruiter intervention.

That might sound basic, but if you've ever coordinated a 5-person panel interview across three time zones, you know this is massive.

### The Dream Job Feature
Here's something wild: Candidates can now mark one application per month as their "Dream Job," which flags them as high-intent applicants. You immediately know who's serious versus who's spray-and-pray applying.

Does it work? [According to Greenhouse users](https://www.joveo.com/greenhouse-recruiting-ultimate-guide/), it's helping them prioritize candidates who are actually excited about the role—not just looking for any job.

### Enhanced Filtering for Interviews
You can now filter interviews by timeframe, candidate name, and job title. Again, sounds basic. But when you're managing 50+ open reqs and trying to figure out who's interviewing when, this kind of granular control saves hours every week.

### Business Intelligence Connector Updates
The January 2025 schema update added the ability to filter prospect pools by job, department, and office. Campaign pools can now be tied to specific jobs and marked as read-only. This is nerdy TA ops stuff, but if you're running reports for executive stakeholders, these updates are gold.

## Integration Ecosystem: 450+ Tools

Greenhouse integrates with over 450 third-party tools. That's not just a number to brag about—it means you can plug in whatever niche tools your team actually uses without building custom integrations.

Need a specific background check provider? It's probably already integrated. Want to connect your scheduling tool, assessment platform, and HRIS? Greenhouse plays nice with all of them.

The philosophy: Be the hub, not the prison. Your recruiting stack should work together, not fight for dominance.

## Advanced Analytics & Reporting

This is where Greenhouse really shines in 2025. The analytics dashboards now include:

- **Structured hiring methodology tracking** that shows where bias might be creeping into your process
- **DE&I metrics** that go beyond surface-level diversity reporting
- **Customizable approval workflows** that let you track bottlenecks in your hiring process
- **Time-to-hire breakdowns** by stage, team, and role type

Most ATS platforms give you data. Greenhouse gives you insights. There's a difference.

## Who Should (And Shouldn't) Use Greenhouse

**You should use Greenhouse if:**
- You're a mid-market or enterprise company with structured hiring needs
- You care about data and want to actually measure quality of hire
- You need DE&I features that go beyond checkbox compliance
- You value integrations and want a platform that plays well with others
- You're willing to invest in a premium ATS (this isn't the budget option)

**You shouldn't use Greenhouse if:**
- You're a tiny startup hiring 2 people a year (overkill)
- You want the cheapest ATS on the market (not happening)
- You don't care about analytics or structured hiring (waste of money)
- You need an all-in-one HRIS+ATS+payroll solution (Greenhouse is ATS-focused)

## Pricing Reality Check

Let's address the elephant in the room: Greenhouse isn't cheap. They don't publish pricing publicly, which usually means "if you have to ask, you can't afford it."

But here's the thing: **7,000+ companies across multiple industries use Greenhouse**, and they're not doing it because the sales team is persuasive. They're doing it because the ROI is there.

If you're making 50+ hires a year and quality of hire actually matters to your business, the investment pencils out. If you're making 5 hires a year, it doesn't.

## The Verdict

Greenhouse earned its #1 rankings in 2025 by shipping features that actually solve problems instead of just adding to feature lists. The AI integration is thoughtful, not gimmicky. The analytics are robust, not overwhelming. The platform is opinionated about structured hiring, which is either a feature or a bug depending on your philosophy.

**Bottom line:** If you're serious about recruiting and want a platform that grows with you, Greenhouse is the safest bet in the ATS market right now. But you'll pay for that safety—in dollars and in commitment to their methodology.

**Rating: 9/10** (would be 10/10 if pricing was more accessible for smaller teams)

**Best for:** Mid-market and enterprise companies who want analytics-driven, structured hiring with best-in-class integrations

**Skip if:** You're a small team with basic hiring needs or you're shopping on price alone
