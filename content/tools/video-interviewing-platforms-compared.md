You're hiring remotely. Video interviews are now standard. The question: should you use Zoom, or invest in a dedicated video interviewing platform?

[Dedicated platforms like HireVue, Spark Hire, and Modern Hire offer features Zoom doesn't](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-interviewing-platforms-2025)—asynchronous interviews, structured evaluation, AI-powered analysis, and candidate experience tools.

But they also cost significantly more than free Zoom calls.

Here's how the major video interviewing platforms compare, and when they're worth the investment.

## What Dedicated Video Interview Platforms Offer (That Zoom Doesn't)

Before comparing platforms, understand what you're paying for:

**Asynchronous (one-way) interviews**: [Candidates record responses to pre-set questions on their own time](https://www.hirevue.com/products/video-interviewing). You review later. No scheduling coordination required.

**Structured interview guides**: [Built-in question banks, evaluation rubrics, and scorecards](https://www.sparkhire.com/products/structured-interviews) that standardize your interview process.

**AI analysis**: [Some platforms analyze candidate responses for keywords, sentiment, and communication patterns](https://www.modernhire.com/solutions/interview-intelligence).

**Collaboration tools**: [Share interview recordings with hiring teams, leave timestamped comments, and consolidate feedback](https://www.hirevue.com/products/collaboration-tools).

**Candidate experience features**: [Practice questions, mobile-friendly interfaces, and scheduling automation](https://www.sparkhire.com/features/candidate-experience).

**Compliance and accessibility**: [EEOC-compliant evaluation, closed captioning, and record retention](https://www.modernhire.com/solutions/compliance).

[If you're doing high-volume hiring, need structured evaluation, or want async screening, dedicated platforms offer value](https://www.lever.co/blog/video-interview-platform-comparison/). If you're doing low-volume hiring with live interviews, Zoom is probably fine.

## HireVue: The Enterprise AI-Powered Leader

[HireVue is the largest and most established video interviewing platform](https://www.hirevue.com/).

**Pricing:** Custom enterprise pricing. Expect $10K-$50K+ annually depending on users and volume.

**What it does well:**

**Asynchronous interviews at scale**: [HireVue excels at high-volume screening](https://www.hirevue.com/products/video-interviewing). Send interview invites to hundreds of candidates, let them record responses on their schedule, review later.

**AI-powered insights**: [HireVue's AI analyzes candidate responses for keywords, communication patterns, and structured signals](https://www.hirevue.com/products/hiring-intelligence). Provides scoring and recommendations.

**Structured evaluation**: [Built-in interview guides, competency frameworks, and standardized scorecards](https://www.hirevue.com/products/assessments) reduce bias and improve consistency.

**Enterprise integrations**: [Seamless integration with Workday, SAP, Oracle, and other enterprise ATS platforms](https://www.hirevue.com/platform/integrations).

**Compliance focus**: [Strong EEOC compliance features, accessibility tools, and audit trails](https://www.hirevue.com/platform/compliance).

**Large customer base**: [Used by Fortune 500 companies globally](https://www.hirevue.com/customers). Candidates often recognize the platform.

**What to consider:**

**Expensive**: [Enterprise pricing means small companies can't afford it](https://www.g2.com/products/hirevue/pricing). This is built for high-volume, large-scale hiring.

**AI analysis has faced criticism**: [HireVue's AI video analysis feature (which analyzed facial expressions and tone) was discontinued in 2021 after bias concerns](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/hirevue-discontinues-facial-analysis). Current AI focuses on speech content, not appearance.

**Can feel impersonal**: [Candidates sometimes dislike one-way video interviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/candidate-experience-async-video-interviews), feeling like they're "talking to a camera" with no human interaction.

**Complexity**: [HireVue is feature-rich but has a learning curve](https://www.capterra.com/p/132546/HireVue/reviews). Requires training and setup time.

**Best for:** Large enterprises doing high-volume hiring (100+ hires annually) who need structured, AI-assisted screening at scale.

**Skip if:** You're a small company, hire infrequently, or candidates frequently object to async video interviews.

## Spark Hire: The Mid-Market Favorite

[Spark Hire targets mid-size companies with simpler, more affordable video interviewing](https://www.sparkhire.com/).

**Pricing:** Starts around $149/month for small teams. Scales to $500-$1,000/month for larger teams.

**What it does well:**

**Affordable and accessible**: [Significantly cheaper than HireVue](https://www.sparkhire.com/pricing), making it accessible for companies with 10-100 employees.

**Easy to use**: [Simple interface, minimal learning curve](https://www.g2.com/products/spark-hire/reviews). Most teams are up and running within a day.

**Async and live interviews**: [Supports both one-way (async) and two-way (live) video interviews](https://www.sparkhire.com/products/video-interviewing) in one platform.

**Structured interview templates**: [Pre-built question sets for common roles](https://www.sparkhire.com/products/interview-templates), plus custom question creation.

**Candidate-friendly**: [Mobile-friendly interface, practice questions, and clear instructions](https://www.sparkhire.com/features/candidate-experience) make the process less intimidating.

**Good integrations**: [Connects with popular ATS platforms like Greenhouse, Lever, and BambooHR](https://www.sparkhire.com/integrations).

**Responsive support**: [Customers consistently praise support quality](https://www.capterra.com/p/125621/Spark-Hire/reviews).

**What to consider:**

**Less AI sophistication**: [Spark Hire doesn't offer the same level of AI analysis as HireVue](https://www.trustradius.com/products/spark-hire/reviews). Evaluation is manual or semi-automated.

**Fewer enterprise features**: [No advanced compliance tools, limited customization](https://www.g2.com/products/spark-hire/reviews) compared to enterprise platforms.

**Async interviews still have drawbacks**: [Some candidates dislike one-way video interviews regardless of platform](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/async-video-interview-candidate-reactions).

**Best for:** Mid-size companies (10-100 employees) doing moderate hiring volume (20-50 hires annually) who want structured video interviewing without enterprise complexity.

**Skip if:** You need advanced AI analysis, have complex compliance requirements, or do very low-volume hiring (Zoom might be enough).

## Modern Hire: The Science-Backed Assessment Platform

[Modern Hire combines video interviewing with validated pre-employment assessments](https://www.modernhire.com/).

**Pricing:** Custom pricing. Mid-range between Spark Hire and HireVue.

**What it does well:**

**Assessment focus**: [Modern Hire integrates video interviewing with cognitive, personality, and skills assessments](https://www.modernhire.com/solutions/pre-employment-assessments). You get holistic candidate evaluation.

**Science-backed**: [Strong emphasis on validation research and bias reduction](https://www.modernhire.com/science). Industrial-organizational psychologists design their assessments.

**Structured interviews**: [Question banks designed around competencies, with scoring rubrics](https://www.modernhire.com/solutions/structured-interviews).

**Compliance and fairness**: [Modern Hire monitors for adverse impact and provides EEOC compliance reporting](https://www.modernhire.com/solutions/compliance).

**Conversational AI interviews**: [Offers AI-driven conversational interviews](https://www.modernhire.com/solutions/conversational-ai) that feel more interactive than traditional one-way video.

**What to consider:**

**Assessment-heavy approach**: [If you just want video interviews without assessments, Modern Hire might be overkill](https://www.capterra.com/p/172568/Modern-Hire/reviews).

**Pricing isn't transparent**: [Custom pricing requires sales conversations](https://www.trustradius.com/products/modern-hire/reviews), which some companies find frustrating.

**Smaller customer base**: [Less name recognition than HireVue](https://www.g2.com/products/modern-hire/reviews), which can affect candidate familiarity.

**Best for:** Companies that want video interviewing integrated with validated assessments, especially in regulated industries or roles requiring specific competencies.

**Skip if:** You only need video interviews (not assessments), want transparent pricing, or do very low-volume hiring.

## When Is Zoom (Or Google Meet/Teams) Good Enough?

[You don't always need a dedicated video interview platform](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/when-to-use-zoom-vs-dedicated-interview-platforms).

**Zoom/Google Meet/Teams work fine when:**

- You're doing low-volume hiring (under 20 hires annually)
- You conduct live interviews only (no async screening needed)
- Your team is small and doesn't need collaboration features
- You have tight budget constraints
- Candidates prefer live conversations over recorded responses

**You need a dedicated platform when:**

- You're doing high-volume screening (50+ candidates for one role)
- You want async interviews to eliminate scheduling coordination
- You need structured evaluation and scorecards
- Compliance and audit trails are critical
- You're hiring globally across time zones

**The hybrid approach:**

[Many companies use async platforms for initial screening, then switch to Zoom for final interviews](https://www.lever.co/blog/video-interview-best-practices/). This balances efficiency and candidate experience.

## Candidate Experience Considerations

[Async video interviews are controversial among candidates](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/candidate-experience-async-video-interviews).

**What candidates dislike:**

- Talking to a camera with no human interaction feels unnatural
- No opportunity to ask questions or clarify
- Time pressure (most platforms impose response time limits)
- Concern that AI is making decisions without human review

**How to improve async interview experience:**

- **Limit questions**: Keep it to 3-5 questions, 10-15 minutes total
- **Allow practice**: Let candidates practice recording before the real thing
- **Be transparent**: Explain why you use async interviews and how responses are evaluated
- **Follow up quickly**: Don't let candidates wait weeks for feedback
- **Use async for screening only**: Move to live interviews for later stages

[Platforms like Spark Hire and Modern Hire emphasize candidate experience features](https://www.sparkhire.com/features/candidate-experience) to address these concerns.

## How To Choose The Right Platform

**For large enterprises (Fortune 500, 500+ employees):** **HireVue** (enterprise features, scale, AI analysis)

**For mid-size companies (50-500 employees):** **Spark Hire** (affordable, easy to use, good support)

**For assessment-focused hiring:** **Modern Hire** (integrated assessments, validated science)

**For small companies or low-volume hiring:** **Zoom/Google Meet** (free, familiar, works fine for live interviews)

**For global hiring across time zones:** **Any async platform** (eliminates scheduling challenges)

## The Bottom Line

[Dedicated video interview platforms offer real value for high-volume, structured hiring](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-interview-platform-roi-analysis).

**Use them when:**
- You're screening 50+ candidates per role
- You need async interviews to save time
- You want structured evaluation and collaboration
- Compliance and consistency are critical

**Stick with Zoom when:**
- You're hiring infrequently
- You only do live interviews
- Budget is tight
- Candidate experience concerns outweigh efficiency gains

[Each platform has strengths](https://www.lever.co/blog/video-interview-platform-comparison/). Choose based on your hiring volume, budget, and whether you value AI-powered analysis (HireVue), ease of use (Spark Hire), or integrated assessments (Modern Hire).

And remember: [no platform fixes bad interview questions or untrained interviewers](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-training-best-practices). Technology enhances process—it doesn't replace good interviewing fundamentals.
