Breezy HR markets itself as "modern recruiting software" but what they really mean is "we're cheap enough that you can actually afford us." And honestly? That's not a bad pitch when most ATS platforms cost more than your first hire.

## What You Actually Get

Standard ATS features: job postings, candidate tracking, interview scheduling, team collaboration. Nothing revolutionary, nothing broken. It's the recruiting software equivalent of store-brand cereal - tastes similar to the name brand, costs way less, identical nutritional value.

The interface is clean enough. Drag-and-drop candidate pipeline, customizable hiring stages, automated email templates. You can post to multiple job boards simultaneously, which saves the mind-numbing task of copying job descriptions 47 times.

[G2 reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/breezy-hr) give it 4.3/5 stars. Users like the ease of setup (you're not hiring consultants to configure it) and the UI doesn't make them want to throw their laptop out a window. Small victories.

## The Price Tag (Finally, Someone Lists It)

Startup plan starts at $189/month for up to 2 active jobs. Bootstrap plan at $319/month for unlimited active jobs and more features. Growth plan at $479/month adds reporting and integrations. These are 2025 prices and they actually publish them, which already makes Breezy better than half their competitors.

Compare that to Greenhouse (thousands per month) or Lever (similar) and you understand the target market. Breezy is for companies that need basic ATS functionality without explaining the software cost to their accountant like it's a luxury car payment.

[Capterra reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/163014/Breezy-HR) confirm the value angle. Users explicitly mention choosing Breezy because everything else was ridiculously overpriced for their hiring volume. When you're making 5-10 hires per year, spending $20K on recruiting software is insane.

## What Works Surprisingly Well

The candidate experience isn't terrible. Application process is mobile-friendly, candidates can schedule their own interview times (which saves an absurd amount of email ping-pong), and automated status updates keep people informed instead of ghosted.

Collaboration features let hiring teams leave feedback, rate candidates, and discuss without needing seventeen Slack threads. It's all in one place, which turns out to be useful when you're trying to remember why you rejected someone three weeks ago.

Chrome extension for sourcing from LinkedIn. You can add candidates directly to your pipeline while browsing profiles. Does it work perfectly? No. Does it beat manually transcribing LinkedIn profiles into spreadsheets? Absolutely.

[User reviews on G2](https://www.g2.com/products/breezy-hr) praise the email integration. Candidate communication syncs with your inbox, so you're not logging into separate systems to respond. Small feature, huge quality-of-life improvement.

## Where It Falls Short (Because Nothing's Perfect)

Reporting is basic unless you're on the Growth plan, and even then it's not winning awards. You get the essentials - time-to-hire, source of hire, pipeline metrics - but advanced analytics require exporting to spreadsheets and doing your own math.

Integrations exist but they're limited. Connects with major HRIS systems and background check providers, but forget niche tools or custom solutions. If your tech stack is complicated, you'll hit walls fast.

Customer support is email-only on cheaper plans. According to [Capterra complaints](https://www.capterra.com/p/163014/Breezy-HR), response times vary wildly. Sometimes quick, sometimes "did they forget about me?" Phone support exists on higher tiers, which helps if you're willing to pay for it.

The AI features feel tacked on because they were. Resume parsing works okay-ish. The "matching" algorithm is basically keyword searching with delusions of grandeur. Don't expect magic, expect slightly-better-than-manual screening.

## Who Should Actually Use This

Small companies making 10-50 hires per year who need real ATS functionality without enterprise pricing. If you're still using spreadsheets and email, Breezy is a massive upgrade for reasonable money.

Startups that can't justify $15K annually on recruiting software but recognize that chaos isn't a system. You need structure, you don't need Greenhouse's full feature set.

Teams that value simplicity over power. If your hiring process is straightforward and you don't need complex approval workflows or integration with seventeen other systems, Breezy does the job.

Who shouldn't use it: enterprises with complicated hiring workflows, companies making hundreds of hires annually, anyone needing sophisticated reporting or custom integrations. You'll outgrow it fast and migration is a pain.

## The Bottom Line

Breezy HR is perfectly adequate, which is exactly what budget-conscious teams need. It's not the best ATS on the market. It's not trying to be. It's trying to be good enough at a price that doesn't require board approval.

Does it have limitations? Obviously. Will those limitations bother you? Depends on your needs and expectations. But if your alternative is spreadsheet hell or paying 10x more for features you'll never use, Breezy makes sense.

It's the recruiting software equivalent of a reliable Toyota. Not fancy, not exciting, but it shows up and does the job without drama. For most small teams, that's exactly enough.
