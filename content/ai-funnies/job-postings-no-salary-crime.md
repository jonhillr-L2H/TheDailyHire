Here's a fun stat: [95% of job seekers say salary range is the most important thing they want to see in a job posting](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/salary-transparency-job-seekers-2025/). Makes sense, right? Why waste time applying for a job that pays half what you're currently making?

And here's another fun stat: [Only 12% of job postings in the US actually include salary information](https://www.indeed.com/lead/salary-transparency-report-2025).

Let that sink in. The thing job seekers care about most—the literal reason people work—is missing from 88% of job postings. It's like posting a house for sale and refusing to list the price. "Interested? Apply and find out!"

This isn't just annoying—[it's actively wasting everyone's time and perpetuating pay inequity](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/salary-transparency-benefits-2025). So why do employers keep doing it?

## The Excuses Employers Give for Hiding Salaries

Every company that refuses to post salary ranges has a reason. Let's go through them and explain why they're all garbage:

### Excuse #1: "We Want to Assess Candidates Before Discussing Salary"

Translation: "We want to lowball you after you've invested hours in our interview process and fallen in love with the job."

[Research shows that delaying salary conversations until late in the process disproportionately disadvantages women and minorities](https://hbr.org/2022/04/the-case-for-salary-transparency), who are less likely to negotiate aggressively. Employers know this. That's why they do it.

**Reality check**: [Candidates who know the salary upfront are more likely to apply if it's a good fit and skip if it's not](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/salary-transparency-increases-applications). Posting salary doesn't reduce applicant quality—it increases it by filtering out mismatches early.

### Excuse #2: "Salary Is Negotiable Based on Experience"

Cool. Post a range. That's what ranges are for.

"$80K-$120K depending on experience" gives candidates enough information to decide if it's worth applying. [Posting "competitive salary" or "salary commensurate with experience" tells candidates nothing](https://www.zippia.com/advice/competitive-salary-definition/).

**Reality check**: [Employers who post salary ranges see 30% more applications from qualified candidates](https://www.indeed.com/lead/salary-transparency-increases-qualified-applicants) because people know it's worth their time to apply.

### Excuse #3: "We Don't Want Current Employees to See What We're Offering New Hires"

Ah yes, the "let's perpetuate pay inequity by keeping everything secret" approach.

[If you're paying new hires significantly more than existing employees doing the same job, that's a retention problem you've created](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/compensation-pay/pay-compression-transparency-risks). Hiding salary ranges doesn't fix it—it just delays the inevitable resentment when employees find out.

**Reality check**: [Pay transparency forces companies to address internal pay equity issues](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/pay-transparency-equity/) instead of hoping employees don't compare notes. That's a feature, not a bug.

### Excuse #4: "It Hurts Our Negotiating Position"

Let me translate: "We want the option to underpay candidates who don't negotiate well."

[Salary transparency removes negotiating power from employers, which is exactly why it's good for candidates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2024/02/salary-transparency-negotiation/). Companies that rely on information asymmetry to keep labor costs down aren't "savvy negotiators"—they're exploiting workers.

**Reality check**: [Companies with transparent pay structures report higher employee satisfaction and lower turnover](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/trends/pay-transparency-retention) because employees trust they're being paid fairly.

### Excuse #5: "Competitors Will See What We Pay"

So? [Your competitors already know your general pay ranges because employees talk, recruiters share data, and sites like Glassdoor exist](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm).

Posting salary in job descriptions doesn't give competitors information they don't already have. [It just helps candidates make informed decisions](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/salary-transparency-benefits).

**Reality check**: [Companies that post salary ranges attract more applicants and fill roles faster](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/salary-transparency-time-to-fill), which means your competitors posting salaries are beating you to top talent.

## The Real Reason Employers Don't Post Salaries

Let's cut the bullshit: [Employers don't post salaries because ambiguity gives them negotiating power](https://www.ere.net/why-employers-hide-salaries/).

If candidates don't know the range, employers can:
- Lowball candidates who don't negotiate
- Pay different amounts for the same role based on negotiation skills (which perpetuates gender and racial pay gaps)
- Avoid internal pay equity conversations
- String candidates along through lengthy interview processes before revealing the salary is way below market

[It's not strategy—it's exploitation of information asymmetry](https://hbr.org/2022/04/the-case-for-salary-transparency).

## States That Have Made Salary Transparency Mandatory (And Why It's Working)

The good news? [Several states have passed laws requiring salary ranges in job postings](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/salary-transparency-laws-by-state/):

**California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, Washington** - [All require employers to disclose salary ranges in job postings](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/state-salary-transparency-laws-2025).

**And it's working**: [Companies in these states report more diverse applicant pools, faster hiring, and better candidate quality](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/salary-transparency-state-law-impact/) because candidates self-select based on realistic expectations.

**The catch**: [Some companies are posting absurdly wide ranges like "$50K-$200K"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/companies-posting-useless-salary-ranges/) to technically comply while providing zero useful information. Congrats on malicious compliance, guys.

## What Job Seekers Can Do About This

Since most employers still refuse to post salaries, here's your playbook:

**Ask upfront in your first conversation** - [Don't wait until the final interview to discuss compensation](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-ask-about-salary). If a recruiter reaches out, ask about salary range in your first response.

**Walk away if they refuse to share** - [If a company won't tell you the salary range after you ask directly, that's a red flag about transparency and respect for your time](https://www.zippia.com/advice/ask-about-salary-in-interview/).

**Use salary research tools** - [Glassdoor, Payscale, and Levels.fyi have crowdsourced salary data](https://www.levels.fyi/) for many companies and roles. Do your research before interviewing.

**Negotiate based on data, not feelings** - [If you get to the offer stage and the salary is below market, show receipts](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/recruiting/how-to-negotiate-salary). "Comparable roles at similar companies pay $X-$Y. Here's the data."

**Advocate for transparency** - [If you're in a state without salary transparency laws, push for them](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/salary-transparency-advocacy/). Contact your representatives. Public pressure works.

## Companies Getting Salary Transparency Right

Not all employers are playing games. [Some companies now post detailed salary info and explain how they arrived at it](https://buffer.com/salary):

**[Buffer](https://buffer.com/salary)** - [Publishes every employee's salary publicly and explains their compensation formula](https://buffer.com/resources/salary-formula/). Radical transparency.

**[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/)** - [Posts salary ranges for every role and documents their compensation philosophy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/). Anyone can calculate what they'd earn.

**[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/handbook/10-how-we-pay)** - [Posts salary bands publicly and doesn't negotiate—everyone in the same role gets paid the same](https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-doesnt-negotiate-salaries/). Removes pay inequity entirely.

**[Whole Foods](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/careers)** - [Employees can look up anyone's salary internally](https://www.businessinsider.com/whole-foods-employees-can-see-each-others-salaries-2014-3). Full internal transparency.

These companies aren't struggling to hire. [They're attracting top talent because candidates trust they'll be paid fairly](https://www.ere.net/salary-transparency-recruiting-advantage/).

## The Bottom Line

[95% of job seekers want salary in job postings. Only 12% of postings include it](https://www.indeed.com/lead/salary-transparency-report-2025). This gap exists because employers benefit from information asymmetry, not because there are legitimate business reasons to hide compensation.

Salary transparency:
- Saves everyone time by filtering out mismatched candidates early
- Attracts more qualified applicants
- Reduces pay inequity
- Builds trust between employers and employees

[Companies that refuse to post salaries are either underpaying, perpetuating inequity, or playing negotiation games](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/salary-transparency-reluctance-reasons). None of those are good reasons.

To employers still hiding salaries: [The states with mandatory transparency laws are increasing every year](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/salary-transparency-laws-by-state/). You can either adapt now or be forced to adapt later. Your choice.

To job seekers: Ask about salary upfront. Walk away from companies that won't tell you. And support salary transparency laws in your state.

Paying people to work isn't a state secret. It's basic information candidates need to make informed decisions. Treating it like classified intel is disrespectful, inefficient, and increasingly illegal.

Post. The. Damn. Salary.

**Key Takeaways:**

- 95% of job seekers want salary in postings; only 12% of postings include it
- Employers hide salaries to maintain negotiating power and avoid pay equity conversations
- Multiple states now require salary transparency by law
- Companies with transparent pay attract better candidates and retain employees longer
- Job seekers should ask about salary upfront and walk away from companies that refuse to share
