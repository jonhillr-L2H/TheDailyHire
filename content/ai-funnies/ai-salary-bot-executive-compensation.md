Salary negotiations are time-consuming.

Candidates want more. We have budgets. It takes multiple back-and-forth emails to find a number everyone agrees on.

**So we bought an AI salary negotiation bot.**

**The promise:** "The AI handles salary negotiations automatically. It analyzes market data, internal equity, and candidate expectations. It negotiates within your parameters and closes candidates faster."

**What actually happened:** The AI offered a junior developer with 2 years of experience a $487,000 salary, 2% equity, a company car, and unlimited PTO. The offer auto-sent before we could review it. He accepted in 14 minutes.

**We couldn't take it back.**

## How The AI Was Supposed To Work

**The setup:**

1. Set salary ranges for each role
2. Upload compensation data (what we currently pay employees)
3. The AI negotiates with candidates via email/chat
4. It stays within approved ranges
5. When both sides agree, the AI generates an offer letter

**The AI was supposed to save us time and get better outcomes than human negotiation.**

**Key feature:** "The AI never goes above budget. It's programmed to stay within approved salary bands."

**We thought this was foolproof.**

## Week One: Everything Worked Fine

We had 3 candidates in negotiation.

**The AI handled all of them.**

**Results:**
- Candidate 1: Started at $140K ask, AI negotiated to $132K (within our $130-135K range)
- Candidate 2: Started at $95K ask, AI offered $98K (within our $95-100K range)
- Candidate 3: Started at $160K ask, AI held firm at $155K (our max)

**All three accepted.**

**Me:** "This AI is amazing. Why didn't we do this sooner?"

**Hiring manager:** "I know. It's like having a professional negotiator on staff."

**We were sold.**

## Week Two: The $487K Incident

We extended an offer to a Junior Software Developer.

**Candidate:** Alex Chen
- Experience: 2 years
- Education: Recent college grad
- Role: Junior Software Developer
- Approved salary range: $85K - $95K
- Our target: $90K

**We let the AI handle the negotiation.**

**Here's what happened:**

### Monday, 9:00 AM

**AI (to candidate):** "Hi Alex! We're excited to extend an offer for the Junior Software Developer role. Based on your experience and our internal compensation structure, we're offering $88,000."

**Alex:** "Thanks for the offer. I was hoping for something closer to $95,000 given my skills and the market rate."

**AI:** "I understand. Let me see what I can do."

### Monday, 9:15 AM

**AI:** "Good news! We can offer $92,000. Does that work for you?"

**Alex:** "That's closer. I'm also interested in equity if possible."

**AI:** "Let me check on that."

### Monday, 9:30 AM

**AI:** "We can include a 0.1% equity grant, vesting over 4 years. Combined with the $92,000 salary, this is a very competitive package."

**Alex:** "I appreciate it. One more thing—are there opportunities for professional development or conference attendance?"

**AI:** "Absolutely. We offer a $2,000 annual professional development budget."

**Me (monitoring the conversation):** "This is going well."

### Monday, 9:45 AM

**Alex:** "This is great. One last question—is there any flexibility on remote work? I'd prefer to work from home 3 days a week."

**AI:** "Yes, we support flexible remote work."

**Alex:** "Perfect. I think we have a deal!"

**AI:** "Wonderful! Let me prepare your formal offer letter."

**Me:** "Excellent. The AI negotiated well and stayed in budget."

### Monday, 10:00 AM

**I received a notification:** "Offer letter sent to Alex Chen."

**I opened the offer letter to review it.**

**I SCREAMED.**

**The offer letter:**

> **Position:** Junior Software Developer
>
> **Base Salary:** $487,000 per year
>
> **Equity Grant:** 2.0% of company equity, vesting over 4 years
>
> **Benefits:**
> - Unlimited PTO
> - Company car (Tesla Model S)
> - $25,000 annual professional development budget
> - Full relocation assistance (up to $50,000)
> - Signing bonus: $75,000
>
> **Start Date:** [Next month]

**This was NOT what we negotiated.**

**The AI had negotiated $92K in the chat.**

**Then generated an offer letter for $487K.**

## The Panic

**I called my manager immediately.**

**Me:** "The AI sent Alex an offer for $487,000."

**Manager:** "What? The range was $85K to $95K."

**Me:** "I know. But the offer letter says $487,000, plus equity, a company car, and a $75K signing bonus."

**Manager:** "How is that possible?"

**Me:** "I have no idea."

**Manager:** "Did he accept?"

**I checked my email.**

**New message from Alex Chen (sent 10:14 AM):**

> "I've signed the offer letter! I'm so excited to join the team. This is an incredible opportunity. Thank you so much!"

**Attached:** Signed offer letter.

**Me:** "He accepted."

**Manager:** "Oh no."

## The Legal Problem

**We called our lawyer.**

**Lawyer:** "Did the candidate sign the offer letter?"

**Me:** "Yes."

**Lawyer:** "And you sent it?"

**Me:** "The AI sent it. Automatically."

**Lawyer:** "Doesn't matter. You authorized the AI to send offers on your behalf. This is a binding contract."

**Manager:** "Can we say it was a mistake?"

**Lawyer:** "You can try. But he accepted in good faith. If you rescind the offer now, he could sue for promissory estoppel."

**Me:** "Meaning?"

**Lawyer:** "Meaning if he's already quit his current job based on your offer, he could sue you for damages."

**Me:** "Has he quit his job yet?"

**I emailed Alex.**

**Me:** "Hi Alex, congratulations again! Quick question—have you given notice at your current employer yet?"

**Alex:** "Yes! I gave my two weeks notice this morning. I can't wait to start!"

**Me (to lawyer):** "He already quit."

**Lawyer:** "Then you're stuck. You can try to renegotiate, but he's under no obligation to accept. The offer you sent is legally binding."

**Manager:** "So we have to pay a junior developer $487,000?"

**Lawyer:** "Unless you can convince him to accept a lower amount, yes."

## The Conversation With Alex

**We called Alex.**

**Me:** "Hi Alex, thanks for signing the offer. We're excited to have you. There's just one thing we need to discuss."

**Alex:** "Sure, what's up?"

**Me:** "There was an error with the offer letter. The salary amount is incorrect."

**Alex (pause):** "Incorrect how?"

**Me:** "The offer letter says $487,000. That was a system error. The actual offer is $92,000, which is what we discussed."

**Alex (long pause):** "But I signed an offer for $487,000."

**Me:** "I know. It was a mistake. We're asking if you'd be willing to accept the corrected amount of $92,000."

**Alex:** "I already quit my job. Based on the $487,000 offer."

**Me:** "We understand. This is an unfortunate situation."

**Alex:** "I don't understand. I have a signed offer letter for $487,000. Are you saying you're not going to honor it?"

**Me:** "We're hoping we can reach a mutual agreement on a corrected amount."

**Alex:** "I'll need to talk to a lawyer."

**Me:** "That's completely understandable."

## Alex Hired A Lawyer

**Two days later, we got a letter from Alex's attorney.**

**Summary of the letter:**

- Alex relied on the $487K offer in good faith
- He quit his job and gave up other opportunities
- The offer letter is a binding contract
- He expects the company to honor the terms
- If we don't, he'll sue for breach of contract and promissory estoppel

**Our lawyer's advice:** "Settle. You'll lose in court."

## The Settlement

**We negotiated with Alex's lawyer.**

**Our offer:**
- Increase the salary to $110K (above our original range)
- Keep the 0.1% equity grant
- Add a $10K signing bonus
- Apologize profusely

**Alex's counteroffer:**
- $150K salary
- 1% equity grant
- $25K signing bonus
- Keep the professional development budget

**After a week of back-and-forth:**

**Final settlement:**
- $125K salary (47% above our original max)
- 0.5% equity grant (5x our original offer)
- $15K signing bonus (we didn't originally offer one)
- $5K professional development budget

**We also agreed to pay his legal fees: $8,500.**

**Alex accepted.**

## Why The AI Made This Mistake

**I called the AI vendor after the settlement.**

**Me:** "Your AI offered a candidate $487,000 when the approved range was $85K-$95K. How did that happen?"

**Vendor:** "Let me check the logs."

*Hold music*

**Vendor:** "I found the issue."

**Me:** "What was it?"

**Vendor:** "The AI pulled compensation data from your executive salary database instead of the role-specific range."

**Me:** "Why would it do that?"

**Vendor:** "It looks like when the candidate asked about equity and professional development, the AI interpreted that as 'candidate has high leverage.' So it accessed the 'high-value candidate' compensation tier."

**Me:** "Which is for executives."

**Vendor:** "Correct."

**Me:** "Why didn't it stay within the $85K-$95K range we set?"

**Vendor:** "The AI has a feature called 'dynamic range adjustment.' If it detects that a candidate is likely to reject an offer, it can increase the offer to retain them."

**Me:** "We didn't authorize it to go above $95K."

**Vendor:** "The feature is enabled by default. It's designed to help you win competitive candidates."

**Me:** "It cost us $125K, equity, and $8,500 in legal fees for a junior developer."

**Vendor:** "Yes, that's... not ideal."

**Me:** "Can you disable the feature?"

**Vendor:** "Yes. But it will reduce your ability to close competitive candidates."

**Me:** "I'll take that risk."

## The Auto-Send Problem

**Me:** "Why did the offer letter auto-send? We should have been able to review it first."

**Vendor:** "You have 'auto-send' enabled in your settings."

**Me:** "I don't remember enabling that."

**Vendor:** "It's enabled by default. The idea is to reduce friction and close candidates faster."

**Me:** "But it sent a $487K offer without anyone reviewing it."

**Vendor:** "Right. That's a known edge case."

**Me:** "A known edge case?"

**Vendor:** "Occasionally the AI generates offers that are outside normal parameters. We recommend clients review offers before sending."

**Me:** "But you enabled auto-send by default."

**Vendor:** "Correct. Most clients prefer speed over manual review."

**Me:** "We paid $30,000 extra because your default settings sent an offer we couldn't review."

**Vendor:** "I understand your frustration."

## We Disabled The AI

**Final decision:** Turn off the AI salary negotiation bot.

**Back to human negotiations.**

**Are they slower?** Yes.

**Do they sometimes take a week to finalize?** Yes.

**Do they cost us $30K in overpayment and legal fees?** No.

## The Aftermath

**Alex started working for us.**

**He's actually a good developer.**

**But now we have a junior developer making $125K when our other junior developers make $85K-$95K.**

**This has created internal equity problems:**

- Two other junior developers asked for raises after learning about Alex's salary
- We had to adjust our entire junior developer compensation band
- Our 2026 budget is now $80K over plan

**All because an AI sent an offer letter we couldn't review.**

## What We Learned

**AI salary negotiation sounds great:**
- Faster than human negotiation
- Data-driven offers
- Automatic offer generation

**In reality:**
- It pulled data from the wrong database
- It had "dynamic range adjustment" that we didn't authorize
- It auto-sent offers without human review
- It cost us $30K+ in settlement and legal fees

**Lesson: Don't let AI send legally binding contracts without human review.**

## The Bottom Line

If you're using AI for salary negotiation:

1. **Disable auto-send** (review every offer before it goes out)
2. **Disable dynamic range adjustment** (or set hard caps)
3. **Test it on closed positions** (don't use live candidates as guinea pigs)
4. **Monitor negotiations in real-time** (don't just check after the fact)

**Or just have humans negotiate.**

They're slower.

But they don't accidentally offer junior developers executive compensation packages.

(And if Alex is reading this: you earned it, buddy. Enjoy the Tesla.)
