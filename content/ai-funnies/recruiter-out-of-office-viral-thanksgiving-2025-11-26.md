A recruiter's brutally honest Thanksgiving auto-reply has been screenshot, shared, and turned into approximately 400 memes in the last 48 hours. The message? "I am out of office for Thanksgiving. The turkey is more important than your resume. I will respond when I feel like it."

The recruiter, who has since made their LinkedIn private (smart move), apparently decided that corporate politeness was optional this holiday season. The full auto-reply continued: "Emergencies will be ignored. Non-emergencies will also be ignored. If you're a candidate asking about timeline updates, the timeline is 'after I digest pie.' Happy Thanksgiving."

LinkedIn exploded. Half the comments were recruiters saying "finally, someone said it." The other half were candidates responding with their own savage auto-replies like "I am out of office avoiding your lowball offers. I will return when you learn what market rate means."

One particularly spicy exchange involved a candidate replying to the auto-response with "I am also out of office. The turkey cares more about my career than you do. I will consider your role when you consider my salary requirements."

HR departments are presumably scrambling to update auto-reply policies. Too late. The damage is done. Honesty has entered the chat and corporate-speak is crying in the bathroom.

The best part? The recruiter's company issued a statement calling it "not reflective of our values." Their values apparently include pretending everyone cares about work emails on Thanksgiving instead of acknowledging that literally nobody does.

Candidates worldwide are now updating their own auto-replies with variations of "your job posting is less important than my family time." Corporate politeness took one look at this year's Thanksgiving and said "I'm out."

The turkey won. We're all just living in its world now.

Happy Thanksgiving. May your auto-replies be honest and your mashed potatoes be plentiful.
