Automated rejection emails are supposed to save time while maintaining professionalism. The company sets up templates, the ATS sends them automatically, and candidates get timely closure.

In practice? Companies set up these templates once, forget about them, and accidentally send emails ranging from brutally honest to completely broken to just plain bizarre.

I collected the best (worst?) automated rejection emails from the past year. These are real. Companies actually sent these to actual candidates.

## Category 1: The "We Forgot to Fill in the Variables" Disaster

**Rejection Email #1:**

> "Dear [CANDIDATE_NAME],
>
> Thank you for applying to [COMPANY_NAME] for the [JOB_TITLE] position. After careful consideration, we have decided to move forward with other candidates whose qualifications more closely match our needs.
>
> We appreciate your interest in [COMPANY_NAME] and wish you the best in your job search.
>
> Sincerely,
> [HIRING_MANAGER_NAME]
> [COMPANY_NAME]"

A candidate received this exact email. The merge fields never populated. They were addressed as "[CANDIDATE_NAME]" and rejected by "[HIRING_MANAGER_NAME]" from "[COMPANY_NAME]."

It's like getting dumped via form letter where your ex forgot to fill in your name.

**Rejection Email #2:**

> "Hi {{firstName}},
>
> We've decided to pursue other candidates for the {{jobTitle}} role. Good luck with your search!"

The double curly braces are giving "we use Handlebars templating and forgot to render the template" energy.

Nothing says "we care about candidate experience" like sending code syntax in your rejection email.

## Category 2: The Accidentally Brutal Honesty

**Rejection Email #3:**

> "Thank you for your interest in the Senior Developer role. Unfortunately, your skills and experience do not meet our minimum requirements, and we will not be moving forward with your application."

Ouch. Technically accurate, but there's a reason most rejection emails are vague. This one basically said "you're not qualifiedâ€”not even close."

**Rejection Email #4:**

> "After reviewing your application, we have determined that you are not a cultural fit for our organization."

"Cultural fit" is already a loaded term, but saying it explicitly in an automated rejection is wild. What part of their resume screamed "won't fit our culture"? Did the ATS detect wrong-vibes energy?

**Rejection Email #5:**

> "While your qualifications are impressive, we have identified candidates who are a better match for this role and our team dynamics."

Translation: "You're qualified, but we like other people better." Thanks for clarifying that I'm hireable, just not by you specifically.

At least be vague about it like everyone else.

## Category 3: The Broken Automation Horror Show

**Rejection Email #6: The Duplicate Nightmare**

One candidate received the same rejection email 14 times. Same content, same timestamp, 14 copies.

Their inbox: "Thank you for your interest..." x14

The ATS apparently got stuck in a loop and decided to really drive the rejection home. Just in case the candidate didn't get the message the first 13 times.

**Rejection Email #7: The Wrong Status Update**

> "Congratulations! We're excited to move you to the next round of interviews for the Marketing Manager position."

The candidate replied enthusiastically, asking about next steps.

Two hours later:

> "We apologize for the previous email. This was sent in error. We will not be moving forward with your application."

The emotional whiplash is incredible. "You're hired! Just kidding, you're rejected."

This is what happens when your automation workflows aren't tested properly.

**Rejection Email #8: The Timing Disaster**

The candidate submitted their application at 2:47 PM.

They received a rejection email at 2:48 PM.

One minute. Their application was reviewed, considered, and rejected in 60 seconds. Either the company has the fastest hiring process in history, or (more likely) the ATS auto-rejected them before a human ever looked.

Nothing says "we value your time and effort" like rejecting someone faster than it takes to read their resume.

## Category 4: The Accidentally Encouraging Rejection

**Rejection Email #9:**

> "While we won't be moving forward with your application at this time, we were impressed by your background and would love to stay in touch for future opportunities!"

This candidate received this email for 6 different roles at the same company over 8 months.

If you're so impressed, maybe actually interview them? This is the recruiting equivalent of "it's not you, it's me" after the sixth rejection.

At some point, "impressed by your background" starts feeling like a lie.

**Rejection Email #10:**

> "You're clearly talented, and we encourage you to apply to other roles that may be a better fit!"

The candidate searched the company's career page. There were no other open roles.

So... apply to jobs that don't exist? Cool, thanks for the encouragement.

## Category 5: The Weirdly Personal Automated Rejection

**Rejection Email #11:**

> "Hi Sarah! Thanks so much for taking the time to apply. We really appreciate you! Unfortunately, this role isn't the right fit right now, but we think you're awesome and hope you'll apply again soon! You rock!"

The exclamation point energy is giving "toxic positivity." Also, this level of enthusiasm in an automated rejection feels disingenuous.

Nobody believes the ATS genuinely thinks they "rock." This is corporate-speak trying way too hard to seem friendly.

**Rejection Email #12:**

> "Thank you for your interest in joining the [Company] family! While we won't be moving forward with your application, we know you'll find the perfect opportunity out there. Keep shining!"

"Keep shining"? Sir, this is a software engineering role, not a motivational poster.

The forced cheerfulness makes it worse. Just say "we're not moving forward" and spare us the Instagram caption energy.

## Category 6: The "We're Not Even Trying to Hide It" Rejection

**Rejection Email #13:**

> "This is an automated message. Your application has been reviewed and we will not be moving forward. Please do not reply to this email as it is not monitored."

At least they're honest? This email basically says "we don't care enough to pretend this is personal, and we definitely don't want to hear from you."

It's the recruiting equivalent of "talk to the hand."

**Rejection Email #14:**

> "Your application has been archived."

That's it. That's the whole email. No "thank you," no "we appreciate your interest," just "your application has been archived."

It's like being told your file went directly into the shredder. Efficient, yes. Kind, absolutely not.

## Category 7: The Absurd Timing

**Rejection Email #15: The Weekend Special**

Received at 2:37 AM on a Sunday.

Nothing says "automated" like getting rejected at 2:37 AM on a weekend. At least pretend a human was involved by sending it during business hours?

**Rejection Email #16: The Holiday Surprise**

Received at 11:58 PM on Christmas Eve.

Happy holidays! Here's your rejection email. Hope you enjoy opening this gift.

The automation doesn't know it's Christmas, but also... maybe delay the send until after the holidays? Read the room, ATS.

## What Companies Could Do Better

Look, automated rejection emails are fine. They're better than ghosting candidates completely. But:

**Test your templates**: Make sure merge fields actually populate. Send yourself a test. Don't subject candidates to "[CANDIDATE_NAME]" emails.

**Don't be brutally honest**: Vague is better than "you're not qualified at all." Standard "moving forward with other candidates" language exists for a reason.

**Check your timing**: Don't send rejections 60 seconds after application. Don't send them at 2 AM. Don't send them on Christmas Eve.

**Fix your workflows**: If your ATS is sending duplicate emails or wrong status updates, your automation is broken. Fix it.

**Make them actually helpful**: If you're rejecting someone, at least make it professional and respectful. "Keep shining" and "you rock" are patronizing. "Thank you for your time and interest" is sufficient.

**Don't encourage reapplying if you have no intention of ever hiring them**: If someone has been rejected 6 times, maybe stop telling them you're "impressed by their background."

## The Bottom Line

Automated rejection emails should be professional, respectful, and actually work. The bar is on the ground.

And yet, companies are sending emails with broken merge fields, rejecting people in 60 seconds, sending duplicates, and trying way too hard to sound enthusiastic while rejecting candidates.

[Candidate experience matters](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-experience-employer-brand-connection). Bad rejection emails damage your employer brand. Candidates talk about these experiences. They post screenshots on Twitter. They tell their networks.

Fix your automated rejection emails. Test them. Make sure they're professional. And for the love of all that is holy, make sure your merge fields actually populate.

Your rejected candidates deserve better than "[CANDIDATE_NAME]."
