You know what's great about resume buzzwords? Absolutely nothing. They're meaningless filler that candidates use because they think it makes them sound professional, and recruiters skim right past them because we've seen the same phrases 10,000 times.

But everyone keeps using them anyway, like we're all trapped in some kind of corporate language purgatory. So let's translate what these phrases actually mean.

## The Buzzword Dictionary

**"Results-oriented professional"**
TRANSLATION: I have completed tasks at jobs before. [Sometimes those tasks had outcomes](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/resume-buzzword-red-flags). I would like you to assume those outcomes were good, even though I haven't provided any specific metrics.

Fun fact: nobody puts "process-oriented failure" on their resume, so "results-oriented" is the professional equivalent of saying you're "breathing."

**"Team player"**
TRANSLATION: I can exist in proximity to other humans without major incidents. [I once attended a meeting without crying](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/meaningless-resume-phrases). I may have even contributed to a group project, though I definitely let other people do most of the work.

**"Detail-oriented"**
TRANSLATION: I noticed a typo once. I'm trying to sound meticulous without providing any evidence of meticulousness. [There's probably a typo somewhere else in this resume, but you haven't found it yet](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/ironic-resume-mistakes).

**"Self-starter"**
TRANSLATION: I showed up to work even when nobody explicitly told me to. [I may have taken initiative on something minor](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/self-starter-examples). Or I might just be claiming this because it sounds good. You'll never know!

**"Excellent communicator"**
TRANSLATION: I can write emails with mostly correct grammar. [I've had conversations with coworkers that didn't end in HR complaints](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/communication-skills-assessment). Once, someone understood what I meant on the first try.

Ironically, the phrase "excellent communicator" is terrible communication because it tells you nothing specific about HOW they communicate or what makes them good at it.

**"Strategic thinker"**
TRANSLATION: I thought about things before doing them sometimes. [I may have suggested an idea once that wasn't immediately terrible](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/strategic-thinking-resume). Or I might just like how fancy this phrase sounds.

If they were truly strategic, they'd use specific examples instead of vague claims. But they're not, so they don't.

**"Proven track record"**
TRANSLATION: I've had more than one job and they didn't fire me. [My "track record" may or may not include any actual achievements](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/unverifiable-resume-claims), but the word "proven" makes it sound like I have data. I don't have data.

**"Thought leader"**
TRANSLATION: I post on LinkedIn sometimes. [Someone once liked my post](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/thought-leadership-claims). I have thoughts, and occasionally, I lead them... nowhere in particular. But it sounds important!

Nobody is a self-proclaimed thought leader. That's something OTHER people say about you, or it's meaningless.

**"Passionate about [extremely generic thing]"**
TRANSLATION: I googled your company five minutes before writing this resume. [I saw some words on your website and put them here](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/generic-resume-personalization). I'm definitely not passionate about this. I'm barely even aware of what "this" is.

"Passionate about innovation" = I want a job
"Passionate about customer service" = I want a paycheck
"Passionate about growth opportunities" = Please hire me

**"Synergy"**
TRANSLATION: I have no idea what I'm talking about, [but I heard someone say this word in a meeting once and it sounded smart](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/corporate-jargon-resume). It means... things working together? Maybe? I really don't know.

If someone uses "synergy" unironically in their resume, they're either in consulting (where meaningless buzzwords are currency) or they're trying way too hard.

**"Leveraged"**
TRANSLATION: I used a thing. [I used a thing to do another thing](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/overused-resume-verbs). Why say "used" when you can say "leveraged" and sound 47% more professional? The meaning is identical but the syllable count is higher, which makes it better somehow.

**"Managed"**
TRANSLATION: This could mean anything from "supervised a team of 20" to "was CC'd on emails about a project." [The deliberately vague verb allows me to imply leadership without technically lying](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-verb-ambiguity).

"Managed a budget" = I had access to a spreadsheet
"Managed a team" = People reported to me, or sat near me, or I met them once
"Managed a project" = I attended meetings about a thing

## Why We Do This To Ourselves

Here's the thing: [candidates use buzzwords because they think ATS systems and recruiters are looking for them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/resume-keywords-myth). [Recruiters skim past buzzwords because they're meaningless without context](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/what-recruiters-actually-read).

It's a perfect system of mutual delusion.

[The solution is embarrassingly simple: use specific examples and quantifiable achievements instead of vague adjectives](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/good-resume-examples). Don't say "results-oriented professional who increased efficiency." Say "reduced processing time by 30% by implementing new workflow system."

One is meaningless corporate speak. The other is actual information.

## The Irony

The absolute funniest part? [Job descriptions are FULL of the exact same buzzwords](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-description-buzzwords). Companies want "self-motivated team players who are detail-oriented strategic thinkers."

So candidates see those buzzwords in job postings and think "ah, I should put those exact words in my resume!" And then recruiters ignore them because everyone says the same thing.

[It's a circle of meaninglessness that nobody will break because we're all too invested in the theater of professional language](https://hbr.org/2024/09/corporate-speak-hiring-process).

We could all just be specific and honest, but where's the fun in that? Much better to keep playing this elaborate game where everyone uses the same 47 phrases and pretends they mean something.

What a system.
