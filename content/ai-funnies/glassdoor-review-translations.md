[Glassdoor reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com) are supposed to give you the real tea about companies. But between fake positive reviews written by HR and negative reviews from bitter ex-employees, it's hard to know what's actually true.

We've developed a translation guide. Here's how to read between the lines.

## The Suspiciously Positive Reviews

**"Great culture and amazing team!"**
- **If it's from a current employee:** [HR is making people write positive reviews](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/fake-glassdoor-reviews-problem). Notice how 15 people all used the exact phrase "great culture" in the same week? Yeah.
- **If it's from a former employee who left less than 6 months ago:** Actually might be genuine. They left on good terms before realizing how dysfunctional it was.
- **Red flag to look for:** [When every positive review uses identical language](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/fake-reviews-detection/). "Fast-paced environment with opportunity for growth" appearing 47 times is not organic.

**"Lots of free snacks and perks!"**
- **Translation:** [The pay is below market but look, there's La Croix in the fridge](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/perks-vs-compensation)! They're trying to distract you from the fact that you can't afford rent with snacks.
- **What to watch for:** If the review spends more time talking about the coffee bar than actual job responsibilities or career growth, that's telling.

**"Everyone is so passionate!"**
- **Translation:** [Everyone works 60+ hours per week and has been gaslit into thinking that's normal](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/passion-exploitation-workplace). "Passionate" is code for "we don't pay overtime and expect you to care about spreadsheets like they're your children."

**"Like a family!"**
- **Translation:** [Inappropriate boundaries, guilt-tripping, and emotional manipulation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2024/09/15/we-are-family-workplace-red-flag/). Real families can't fire you for missing arbitrary performance metrics. This is not the heartwarming comparison they think it is.
- **Also means:** Lots of drama, everyone's in each other's business, and that one person who's been there 15 years has too much power.

## The Negative Reviews (That Are Actually Helpful)

**"Management has no idea what they're doing"**
- **If you see this in multiple reviews spanning different time periods:** [Probably true](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/negative-reviews-patterns/). One disgruntled person might be bitter, but 20 people over 3 years? That's a pattern.
- **What it actually means:** Priorities change weekly, no clear direction, lots of "let's circle back" meetings that never actually resolve anything.

**"Work-life balance is nonexistent"**
- **Translation:** You will get Slack messages at 10 PM. [You will be expected to respond](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/after-hours-work-communication-expectations). Your PTO will be "unlimited" in theory and impossible to actually use in practice.
- **How to verify:** Check if reviews mention "fast-paced" as a positive in the same breath. That's code for "we're understaffed and nobody ever logs off."

**"They only promote from outside / Internal candidates never get promoted"**
- **Both statements are red flags, just different ones:**
  - "Only promote from outside" = [No career path, your experience doesn't matter here](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-management/internal-mobility-problems)
  - "Only internal promotions" = [Insular culture that doesn't value fresh perspectives](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-management/internal-promotion-bias)

**"HR is useless"**
- **Almost always true everywhere, but when it shows up repeatedly:** [It means HR actively protects the company over employees in egregious ways](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/hr-employee-trust-issues). Not just normal corporate HR uselessnessâ€”weaponized incompetence.

## The Passive-Aggressive "Constructive Feedback" Reviews

**"Great place if you like [terrible thing]"**
- **Example:** "Great place if you don't mind working weekends!"
- **Translation:** [This person is SO ANGRY but trying to stay professional](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/responding-to-negative-reviews/). They're warning you while maintaining plausible deniability. Heed the warning.

**"Pros: Pay is okay. Cons: [17 paragraphs of detailed grievances]"**
- **Translation:** [They had THINGS TO SAY and have been holding this in for months](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/employer-brand/negative-glassdoor-reviews-analysis). The unbalanced ratio of pros to cons tells you everything.
- **Bonus translation:** When the pros are generic ("nice office space") and the cons are specific ("boss threw a stapler during a meeting"), believe the specifics.

## The Review Red Flags

**All 5-star reviews with no critical feedback:**
[Fake reviews or coerced reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/fake-reviews-detection/). Real humans have complaints. Even great companies have areas for improvement. Perfect scores across the board? Suspicious.

**All 1-star reviews with personal attacks:**
[Might be one very angry person using multiple accounts](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/responding-to-negative-reviews/), or a competitor sabotaging. Look for specific, verifiable complaints vs. "everyone here is terrible."

**Sudden spike in positive reviews after negative publicity:**
[Damage control](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/glassdoor-reputation-management/). Company had a scandal, now there's mysteriously 50 glowing reviews in 2 weeks. Sure, Jan.

**CEO approval rating wildly disconnected from overall rating:**
[Company has 2.8 stars, but CEO has 97% approval?](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/ceo-approval-rating-analysis/) Either the CEO is writing their own reviews or there's some serious bootlicking happening.

## How to Actually Use Glassdoor

1. **Read the 3-star reviews.** [These are often the most honest](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/glassdoor-middle-reviews-most-accurate). People who give 3 stars see both good and bad and are willing to be balanced.

2. **Look for patterns over time.** [One review about a toxic manager might be an isolated incident. Twenty reviews over 3 years? Pattern](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/review-trends-analysis/).

3. **Check review dates against company events.** [Sudden negativity after layoffs or leadership changes is informative](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/employer-brand/glassdoor-reviews-company-changes).

4. **Pay attention to how the company responds to reviews.** [Defensive, corporate non-answers? Red flag. Specific, thoughtful responses acknowledging real issues? Green flag](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/responding-to-reviews-best-practices/).

5. **Cross-reference with other sources.** [Check Reddit, Blind, LinkedIn. If the Glassdoor reviews say one thing but everywhere else says something different, dig deeper](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/employer-research-multiple-sources/).

## The Bottom Line

[Glassdoor reviews are useful but not gospel](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/how-candidates-use-reviews/). Every company has some negative reviews from bitter ex-employees. Every company has some suspiciously positive reviews from people trying too hard.

[Your job is to spot the patterns and read between the corporate-speak lines](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/evaluating-glassdoor-reviews).

And remember: if a company's response to negative reviews is "this person is lying and we're perfect," [that tells you more about the company culture than the review itself](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/defensive-review-responses).

Happy sleuthing!
