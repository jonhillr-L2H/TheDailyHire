Look, we all know candidates are using ChatGPT to write cover letters and polish resumes. That's basically expected at this point. But using ChatGPT **live during a video interview** while pretending the answers are coming from your brain? That's a whole different level of bold.

And getting caught doing it? **Chef's kiss.**

## The Setup

[According to a hiring manager who shared the story on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tech-hiring-manager-chatgpt-interview-disaster), they were conducting a video interview for a mid-level software engineering position. Standard technical screening—discussing past projects, asking about problem-solving approaches, talking through architecture decisions.

The candidate was doing surprisingly well. Articulate answers, solid technical depth, good communication. Maybe a little slow to respond, but some people think before they speak. Totally normal.

**Then the hiring manager noticed the eye movements.**

The candidate's eyes kept tracking left-to-right, left-to-right, like they were reading text. Not looking at notes—actually reading full paragraphs. The slight delay between questions and answers. The perfect, almost rehearsed phrasing of complex technical explanations.

[Experienced interviewers know what ChatGPT-generated answers sound like](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/identifying-ai-generated-interview-responses-2025)—they're comprehensive, well-structured, and just a bit too polished for spontaneous conversation.

## The Test

The hiring manager decided to test their theory. They asked an off-script question that required specific knowledge about the candidate's resume:

**"You mentioned you reduced database query time by 60% at your last company. Walk me through the specific queries you optimized and what indexes you added."**

[This should be easy for someone who actually did the work](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/behavioral-interview-verification-techniques-2025). You remember the problem you solved. You can describe the solution without needing to read anything.

**The candidate froze.**

Eyes darted. Long pause. Then: "Let me think about the best way to explain this..."

More eye tracking. Left to right. Reading.

Then a response that was clearly AI-generated: [A generic explanation of database optimization techniques that didn't reference the specific project mentioned on their resume](https://www.hrdive.com/news/ai-interview-responses-generic-patterns-2025/).

## The Gotcha

The hiring manager decided to go for the kill. They asked a deliberately nonsensical technical question designed to sound real but make no sense:

**"How would you implement a distributed hash table using a recursive FIFO queue in a stateless microservice architecture?"**

[This is word salad](https://www.techjargontest.com/nonsense-technical-questions). It sounds technical but doesn't actually mean anything coherent. [Any experienced engineer would pause and ask clarifying questions or point out that the question doesn't make sense](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-nonsense-question-technique-2025).

ChatGPT, however, will confidently generate an answer to anything.

The candidate's response: "Great question. You'd start by implementing the FIFO queue as a recursive data structure within the service layer, then use consistent hashing to distribute the keys across nodes..."

**Complete nonsense delivered with complete confidence.**

## The Confrontation

The hiring manager stopped them mid-sentence: **"Are you using ChatGPT right now?"**

Silence.

"I can see your eyes reading something off-screen. Your answers are too polished and don't reference your actual experience. And you just confidently explained a technical concept that doesn't exist."

The candidate's face went through several emotions in rapid succession: panic, embarrassment, defiance, then resignation.

[They tried to recover](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-interview-dishonesty-recovery-attempts/): "I was just using it as a reference to make sure I explained things clearly..."

Nope. Interview over.

## The Aftermath

[The hiring manager shared the story as a warning](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chatgpt-interview-cheating-2025): **Interviewers are getting better at spotting AI-generated responses in real-time.**

The signs they look for:
- Eye movements indicating reading from a screen
- Unnaturally polished, structured answers to spontaneous questions
- Delays between question and response that match typing + AI generation time
- Answers that sound like they came from documentation rather than personal experience
- Inability to provide specific details about general claims
- Confident responses to nonsensical questions

[User comments on the post were divided](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/chatgpt_interview_caught/):

**"This is cheating, period. You're not hiring the person, you're hiring ChatGPT."**

**"Is using ChatGPT during an interview any different than Googling something? Both are resourcefulness."**

**"The candidate isn't being tested on memorization—they're being tested on experience and problem-solving. ChatGPT can't fake lived experience."**

**"I use ChatGPT to help structure my answers before interviews. Using it LIVE is wild."**

## The Bigger Trend

[This isn't an isolated incident](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ai-interview-cheating-prevalence-2025). Hiring managers across industries report catching candidates using AI during video interviews:

[Sales candidates reading AI-generated responses to objection-handling questions](https://www.hrdive.com/news/sales-interview-ai-usage-detection/).

[Marketing candidates using ChatGPT to generate campaign strategies on-the-fly](https://www.talentculture.com/marketing-interview-ai-responses-2025/).

[Customer support candidates reading AI scripts for scenario-based questions](https://www.customerservicemanager.com/ai-interview-cheating-customer-support/).

[Some companies are responding by requiring candidates to share their screen during technical interviews](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/screen-sharing-interview-requirements-2025). [Others are moving away from video interviews entirely for initial screens, relying instead on take-home assignments where AI use is expected and evaluated differently](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/interview-format-changes-ai-era-2025/).

## The Ethics Debate

Here's where it gets interesting: **Is using ChatGPT during an interview fundamentally different than using it for your actual job?**

[Many jobs involve using AI tools daily](https://www.hrdive.com/news/ai-workplace-usage-2025/). [Developers use GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/copilot-usage-2025/). [Marketers use ChatGPT for content drafts](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/chatgpt-marketing-usage/). [Analysts use AI for data interpretation](https://www.datascience.com/ai-analytics-tools-2025/).

[If the job itself involves using AI, why is using AI during the interview cheating?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ai-interview-usage-ethics-debate-2025)

**The counterargument:** [Interviews assess problem-solving ability, communication skills, and experience](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/what-interviews-actually-measure-2025). [Using AI to generate responses in real-time means the interviewer is evaluating the AI's abilities, not the candidate's](https://www.talentculture.com/interview-authenticity-ai-era/).

[Plus, you're lying by omission—presenting AI output as your own thinking without disclosure](https://www.hrdive.com/news/interview-honesty-ai-disclosure/).

## The Recruiter Take

Recruiters and hiring managers are adapting:

**Ask for specific examples that require lived experience**: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager and how you handled it." [ChatGPT can't answer this about YOUR specific experience](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ai-proof-interview-questions-2025).

**Follow-up questions that drill into details**: [Generic AI answers fall apart under scrutiny](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/interview-follow-up-question-techniques-2025). "You mentioned you improved conversion rates by 30%—walk me through the A/B test methodology."

**Nonsense questions**: [Ask a question that sounds technical but is meaningless](https://www.techjargontest.com). [Real experts will question it; ChatGPT will answer it confidently](https://www.hrdive.com/news/nonsense-question-interview-technique/).

**Screen sharing requirements**: [For technical roles, require candidates to share screens during problem-solving](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/screen-sharing-technical-interviews/).

**In-person or on-site interviews**: [The old-fashioned solution—much harder to use ChatGPT when you're physically in a conference room](https://www.talentculture.com/in-person-interview-resurgence-2025/).

## The Bottom Line

[Using ChatGPT to prep for interviews? Smart](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/ai-interview-preparation-best-practices-2025). [Using it to practice answering common questions? Totally fine](https://www.hrdive.com/news/chatgpt-interview-practice-strategies/). [Using it to write thank-you notes after interviews? No one cares](https://www.themuse.com/advice/ai-thank-you-notes-2025).

**Using it LIVE during the interview while pretending the answers are yours? That's just stupid.**

[You're going to get caught](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/ai-interview-cheating-detection-rates-2025). [And even if you don't, you're setting yourself up to fail in a job you lied your way into](https://www.hrdive.com/news/interview-cheating-job-performance-correlation/).

[The candidate in this story didn't just lose the job opportunity—they burned their reputation with that hiring manager and likely their entire network once the story got shared](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-dishonesty-reputational-damage-2025).
