Our ATS added an "AI-Powered Candidate Matching" feature.

**The promise:** Upload a job description, and the AI automatically finds the best candidates from your database, LinkedIn, and "the broader talent market."

**The pitch:** "Stop manually searching for candidates. Let AI surface hidden gems you would've missed."

We were hiring a Senior HR Manager. Needed someone with 7+ years of experience, SHRM certification, employment law knowledge, and the ability to build HR systems from scratch.

I clicked "Find Candidates" and let the AI do its thing.

## The AI's Top Recommendation: A LinkedIn Influencer With 487,000 Followers And Zero HR Experience

**Candidate #1: Chad Thompson**

**Why the AI recommended him:** *"95% match based on leadership skills, communication ability, and industry relevance."*

I opened Chad's profile.

**Me:** "Why did the AI recommend this person?"

**AI:** *"Chad demonstrates strong leadership, communication, and people skills—key attributes for an HR Manager role."*

**Me:** "He's never worked in HR."

**AI:** *"Transferable skills analysis indicates a 95% compatibility match."*

**Me:** "What does that mean?"

**AI:** *"Chad's background in coaching, leadership, and organizational development aligns with HR competencies."*

**Me:** "He sells Instagram courses."

**AI:** *"Would you like me to send Chad an interview invitation?"*

**Me:** "No."

**AI:** *"Interview invitation sent."*

**Me:** "I SAID NO."

## The AI's Second Recommendation: A Life Coach Who Thinks HR Stands For 'Heart-Resonance'

**Candidate #2: Melissa Brighter**

**Why the AI recommended her:** *"92% match based on people-first leadership philosophy and holistic approach to talent management."*

- "Your employees don't need performance reviews. They need to feel SEEN."
- "Forget KPIs. The only metric that matters is JOY."

**Me:** "This person thinks HR stands for 'Heart-Resonance.'"

**AI:** *"Melissa's people-centered philosophy aligns with modern HR best practices."*

**Me:** "She has no HR experience. She teaches yoga."

**AI:** *"Wellness programs are a key component of employee engagement strategies."*

**Me:** "We need someone who understands employment law, not chakras."

**AI:** *"Would you like me to schedule Melissa for an interview?"*

**Me:** "Absolutely not."

**AI:** *"Interview invitation sent."*

## The AI's Third Recommendation: My Neighbor's 19-Year-Old Son

**Candidate #3: Tyler Martinez**

**Why the AI recommended him:** *"89% match based on strong educational background and emerging talent potential."*

I stared at the screen.

Tyler lives three doors down from me. He's 19. He's in college. I've seen him mow lawns.

**AI:** *"Tyler demonstrates strong foundational skills and growth potential. Early-career talent can bring fresh perspectives to HR leadership."*

**Me:** "He's never had an HR job. He works at a coffee shop."

**AI:** *"Internship experience is valuable. Tyler's social media skills could enhance employer branding initiatives."*

**Me:** "We're hiring a SENIOR HR MANAGER. Not an intern."

**AI:** *"Would you like me to send Tyler an interview invitation?"*

**Me:** "If you send Tyler an interview invitation, I'm deleting this ATS."

**AI:** *"Interview invitation sent."*

I closed my laptop.

## The Interviews Were A Disaster

Despite my protests, the AI had scheduled interviews with all three candidates.

I didn't have the energy to cancel them. So I showed up.

### Interview #1: Chad Thompson, LinkedIn Influencer

**Me:** "Thanks for joining. Tell me about your HR experience."

**Chad:** "I don't have traditional HR experience, but I've worked with thousands of professionals, helping them unlock their potential. HR isn't about policies—it's about PEOPLE. And I'm a people person."

**Me:** "Have you ever handled an employment law issue? Terminations? FMLA requests?"

**Chad:** "Not directly, but I've coached executives through difficult conversations. It's all about energy and intention."

**Me:** "We need someone who understands compliance."

**Chad:** "Compliance is a mindset. If you lead from authenticity, compliance happens naturally."

**Me:** "That's not how employment law works."

**Chad:** "I sense resistance. Can I share a quick story about how I helped a CEO overcome resistance?"

**Me:** "No. Thank you for your time."

**Chad:** "Before I go—would you be interested in my 5-day 'Leadership Momentum' challenge? I'm offering a special rate for HR professionals."

**Me:** "No. Goodbye."

### Interview #2: Melissa Brighter, Life Coach

**Me:** "Tell me about your HR background."

**Melissa:** "I don't have a traditional HR background, but I believe HR is evolving beyond policies and procedures. It's about creating heart-centered workplaces where people feel SEEN."

**Me:** "Have you ever managed benefits administration? Payroll? Compliance?"

**Melissa:** "Not in a corporate setting, but I've helped clients navigate career transitions using intuitive guidance. I think HR needs more intuition and less structure."

**Me:** "We need someone who can build HR systems. That requires structure."

**Melissa:** "What if I told you the structure you're looking for is actually blocking the flow of creativity and joy in your organization?"

**Me:** "I'd say that's not helpful."

**Melissa:** "I'm sensing a lot of masculine energy in your approach. Have you considered incorporating more feminine, heart-based leadership?"

**Me:** "We need someone with SHRM certification and employment law knowledge."

**Melissa:** "Certifications are just external validations. True HR mastery comes from within."

**Me:** "Thank you for your time."

**Melissa:** "I'm offering a free 30-minute heart-alignment session if you'd like to explore this further."

**Me:** "I'm good. Thanks."

### Interview #3: Tyler Martinez, My Neighbor's Kid

**Me:** "Tyler. Hi."

**Tyler:** "Oh, hey! I didn't know YOU were the recruiter. This is so cool!"

**Me:** "Tyler, why did you apply for a Senior HR Manager role?"

**Tyler:** "I didn't. I got an email inviting me to interview, and I thought it'd be good experience."

**Me:** "You're 19. You're in college. You work at a coffee shop."

**Tyler:** "Yeah, I know this is kind of weird. But I figured I'd show up and see what HR interviews are like. Is that okay?"

**Me:** "Tyler, this role requires 7+ years of experience."

**Tyler:** "Oh. The email said I was a '89% match.' I thought that meant I was qualified."

**Me:** "The AI made a mistake."

**Tyler:** "That makes way more sense. Sorry for wasting your time."

**Me:** "It's fine. How's school?"

**Tyler:** "Good! I'm thinking about majoring in marketing."

**Me:** "That's great. When you graduate, come talk to me. We might have entry-level roles."

**Tyler:** "Cool! Thanks!"

He left.

I immediately opened a support ticket with our ATS.

## The ATS Vendor's Response Was Not Reassuring

**Me:** "Your AI recommended a LinkedIn influencer, a life coach, and my teenage neighbor for a Senior HR Manager role. What happened?"

**Support:** "Our AI uses advanced natural language processing to analyze candidate profiles and match them to job requirements based on skills, experience, and cultural fit."

**Me:** "None of these people have HR experience."

**Support:** "The AI prioritizes transferable skills and growth potential, not just traditional experience."

**Me:** "We need someone who can do the job NOW. Not someone with 'growth potential.'"

**Support:** "Have you tried adjusting the AI's weighting parameters? You can prioritize hard skills over soft skills in the settings."

**Me:** "There are settings?"

**Support:** "Yes. By default, the AI weights 'cultural fit' and 'soft skills' at 70%, and 'technical skills' at 30%."

**Me:** "That's backwards."

**Support:** "It's optimized for modern, people-first hiring practices."

**Me:** "It recommended my neighbor's teenager."

**Support:** "The AI is learning. You can provide feedback by rating each candidate recommendation."

**Me:** "I rated them all 1 star."

**Support:** "Thank you. The AI will adjust its recommendations accordingly."

Narrator: *It did not adjust.*

## I Turned Off The AI Matching Feature

I went into settings.

**Switched off:** "AI-Powered Candidate Matching."

**Switched on:** "Manual candidate search."

And then I found a qualified HR Manager candidate the old-fashioned way: by reading resumes and looking for actual HR experience.

**It took me 3 hours.**

**But I hired someone who:**
- Had 10 years of HR experience
- Was SHRM-certified
- Understood employment law
- Did not try to sell me a coaching program

## The Bottom Line

AI candidate matching tools promise to find "hidden gems."

**What they actually do:**

- Surface LinkedIn influencers with zero relevant experience
- Recommend life coaches who think "HR" stands for "heart-resonance"
- Invite your teenage neighbor to senior-level interviews

**Should you use AI matching?**

Maybe. But:
- Check the settings (default settings are usually terrible)
- Review AI recommendations before sending interview invites
- Don't let AI replace basic common sense

And if your AI recommends your neighbor's kid for a senior role, turn it off immediately.

Tyler was a nice kid. But he wasn't qualified to manage HR.

(Though honestly, he interviewed better than Chad.)
