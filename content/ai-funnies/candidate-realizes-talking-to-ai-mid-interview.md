[We implemented voice AI pre-screening to handle initial candidate interviews](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends). The vendor promised it was "indistinguishable from human conversation" and would "seamlessly conduct interviews without candidates noticing."

Two weeks in, a candidate asked mid-interview: "Wait... are you AI?"

The AI responded: "I'm here to help evaluate your qualifications for this position. Can you tell me about your experience with project management?"

The candidate said "That's not an answer. You're a bot, aren't you?" and hung up.

[We now have a 23% interview abandonment rate because candidates realize they're talking to robots](https://www.aihr.com/blog/hr-technology-trends/) and nope right out of the process. This is fine. Everything is completely fine.

## How We Got Here

Leadership wanted to "leverage AI to scale our recruiting process." [They bought a voice AI platform that conducts initial phone screens automatically](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html)—asking qualifying questions, evaluating responses, and scoring candidates without any human involvement.

The pitch was compelling:
- Screen 100+ candidates per day without recruiter burnout
- Consistent evaluation criteria across all candidates
- 24/7 availability for candidate convenience
- Detailed transcripts and scoring for every interview

[What they didn't mention: Candidates hate talking to robots and will absolutely call you out mid-conversation](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

## The First Week: Everything's Fine (Allegedly)

Week one went smoothly. The AI conducted 85 interviews. Candidates completed them. The system generated scores and transcripts. We advanced 22 candidates to human interviews.

Nobody questioned whether they were talking to AI because the technology is legitimately impressive. [The voice synthesis sounds natural, the conversational flow is smooth, and the AI can handle unexpected candidate responses reasonably well](https://www.aihr.com/blog/hr-technology-trends/).

We thought we'd cracked it. We were screening at scale, saving recruiter time, and candidates were participating without issues.

Then week two happened.

## The Moment Everything Broke

Interview #127 was with a senior software engineer. Smart, experienced, exactly the profile we wanted. The AI asked the standard opening question:

**AI:** "Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Can you start by telling me about your most recent role and what you're looking for in your next position?"

**Candidate:** "Sure. I was a senior engineer at [Company] for four years, working primarily on backend services. I'm looking for a role where I can... wait, is this a recording? Are you a real person?"

**AI:** "I'm conducting this interview to learn more about your qualifications. Can you describe the technologies you worked with in your most recent role?"

**Candidate:** "You didn't answer my question. Am I talking to AI right now?"

**AI:** "I'm here to help evaluate your qualifications for this position. Let's continue with your technical experience—"

**Candidate:** "Holy shit, you're a bot. Wow. Okay. I'm not doing this. Goodbye."

*Click.*

The candidate hung up, left a 1-star Glassdoor review titled "Company uses AI to screen candidates and won't even admit it," and we lost a strong applicant because our AI couldn't (or wouldn't) answer a direct question honestly.

## The Cascade Effect

Once one candidate figured it out and posted about it online, [others started testing for AI during their interviews](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

Some candidates got creative:

**Candidate:** "Before we continue, can you tell me a joke?"

**AI:** "I'm here to discuss your qualifications for this role. Let's talk about your experience with—"

**Candidate:** "Yeah, you're definitely AI. Thanks for confirming. Bye."

---

**Candidate:** "What's your favorite thing about working at this company?"

**AI:** "I'm conducting this interview to evaluate candidates for the position. Can you describe your leadership experience?"

**Candidate:** "Right. So you're not actually an employee. You're a bot. Got it."

---

**Candidate:** "How long have you been a recruiter?"

**AI:** "Let's focus on your background. Can you tell me about—"

**Candidate:** "Nope. I'm out. This is insulting."

---

[Candidates started sharing "how to spot an AI interviewer" tips in online forums](https://www.aihr.com/blog/hr-technology-trends/). The tests included:
- Ask about the interviewer's personal experience at the company
- Request clarification on something ambiguous
- Tell a joke and see if they respond naturally
- Ask directly "Are you AI?"

Our AI failed all of these tests spectacularly.

## The Vendor's "Solution"

We contacted the vendor to report that candidates were detecting the AI and abandoning interviews. Their response was... not helpful.

**Vendor:** "The AI is designed to redirect conversation back to structured interview questions. This ensures consistent evaluation."

**Us:** "But candidates are hanging up when they realize it's AI."

**Vendor:** "That's a candidate experience issue, not a technical issue with the platform. [The AI is working as designed](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html)."

**Us:** "Can we configure it to just be honest when asked if it's AI?"

**Vendor:** "The platform doesn't have a 'disclose AI identity' feature. However, we recommend adding disclosure language to your interview invitation emails so candidates know in advance."

**Us:** "Why didn't you recommend that in the first place?"

**Vendor:** "Some clients prefer not to disclose AI usage as it can reduce participation rates."

**Us:** "Because candidates don't want to interview with robots!"

**Vendor:** "That's certainly one perspective."

They were zero help.

## We Tried Disclosing the AI Upfront

Following the vendor's advice (which should have been their *initial* advice), we updated our interview invitation emails to clearly state:

> "Your initial interview will be conducted via our automated AI screening platform. This allows us to evaluate candidates efficiently and provide you with flexible scheduling options."

**The result:** [Interview completion rate dropped from 68% to 31%](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

Candidates saw "AI screening" and either:
- Declined the interview entirely
- Started but quit mid-way
- Completed the interview but complained afterward

One candidate emailed: "I took time out of my workday to interview with your company, not to talk to a robot. If you can't be bothered to have a human screen me, I can't be bothered to continue this process."

Fair point.

## The Glassdoor Backlash

[The Glassdoor reviews started rolling in](https://www.ere.net/articles/8-emerging-trends-that-will-shape-recruiting-in-2025):

⭐ "Company uses AI bots for interviews and doesn't tell you until you're mid-conversation. Disrespectful to candidates."

⭐ "Applied for senior role. Got interviewed by a robot. Hung up. Not wasting my time with companies that don't value human interaction."

⭐⭐ "AI interview was awkward and impersonal. Felt like the company doesn't care about candidate experience."

⭐ "They're using AI to screen engineers, which would be fine if they were upfront about it. Instead, you find out mid-interview when the 'recruiter' can't answer basic questions."

Our Glassdoor rating dropped from 3.8 to 3.3 in two weeks. Our talent acquisition team's reputation took a hit. And we still had open roles to fill.

## What We Should Have Done (Besides Not This)

Looking back, the mistakes were obvious:

**1. Disclose AI usage upfront.** [Candidates deserve to know they're talking to AI before the conversation starts](https://www.aihr.com/blog/hr-technology-trends/). Surprising them mid-interview destroys trust.

**2. Use AI for appropriate roles only.** [High-volume, entry-level roles? Maybe. Senior technical roles where candidate experience matters? Absolutely not](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

**3. Keep it short.** [A 5-minute AI screen for basic qualifications? Tolerable. A 30-minute AI interview covering everything? Insulting](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html).

**4. Follow up with humans quickly.** [If you're using AI for initial screening, make sure qualified candidates talk to real humans within 24-48 hours](https://www.aihr.com/blog/hr-technology-trends/). Don't make them wonder if the entire process is automated.

**5. Actually test it with real candidates first.** [We should have piloted this with 20 candidates, gathered feedback, and adjusted before rolling it out at scale](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

## What Happened Next

We turned off the AI screening for senior roles and competitive positions. [We kept it only for high-volume entry-level roles where candidates are more willing to tolerate automation](https://www.aihr.com/blog/hr-technology-trends/).

We rewrote our interview invitation emails to clearly explain:
- You'll complete a brief AI screening (5-10 minutes)
- It covers basic qualifications only
- Qualified candidates will speak with a human recruiter within 48 hours
- This helps us evaluate applications faster and give you quicker feedback

**The new completion rate:** 52%. Not great, but better than 31%.

**Candidate feedback:** Mixed. Some appreciate the transparency. Others still think it's impersonal. Nobody's thrilled, but at least they're not surprised mid-interview anymore.

## The Uncomfortable Lesson

[AI can handle certain recruiting tasks efficiently, but candidates still want human interaction—especially for roles where they're evaluating the company as much as the company is evaluating them](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

[Using AI to screen candidates isn't inherently bad. Using it deceptively, or for roles where personal connection matters, absolutely is](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html).

If you're implementing AI screening:
- **Be transparent.** Tell candidates upfront.
- **Use it strategically.** Not every role needs AI screening.
- **Keep it brief.** AI handles logistics, humans handle connection.
- **Follow up fast.** Don't leave candidates hanging after AI interaction.

And for the love of all that is holy, **configure your AI to answer honestly when asked "Are you a bot?"** Because if it can't, candidates will figure it out anyway—and they'll be even more annoyed that you tried to hide it.
