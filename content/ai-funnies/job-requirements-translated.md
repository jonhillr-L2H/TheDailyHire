Job descriptions are written in a secret code designed to make terrible positions sound amazing. It's like when restaurants call something "rustic" because "we burned it" doesn't sound as appetizing.

We've cracked the code. Here's what these phrases actually mean.

## The Translations

**"Fast-paced environment"**
TRANSLATION: We're perpetually understaffed and everyone is drowning. You'll have the responsibilities of three people and the salary of 0.7 people. Also, your manager sends Slack messages at 11 PM expecting immediate responses.

**"Wear many hats"**
TRANSLATION: We don't actually know what this job is supposed to do, so we're going to pile random tasks on you until we figure it out. Oh, we won't figure it out. You'll just keep doing five jobs forever.

**"Work independently"**
TRANSLATION: Nobody here has time to train you or answer your questions. You'll be thrown into the deep end on day one, and when you inevitably struggle, we'll act surprised that you need guidance. Figure it out!

**"Competitive salary"**
TRANSLATION: Below market rate, but we're hoping you don't know that. We Googled "average salary" once in 2019 and never updated our research. If you ask about the actual number before the final interview, we'll act personally offended.

**"Flexible schedule"**
TRANSLATION: You'll be expected to work whenever we need you, which is always. But hey, you can come in at 9:15 instead of 9:00, so like, that's flexible, right?

**"Family atmosphere"**
TRANSLATION: Dysfunctional relationships and unclear boundaries. Your boss will expect you to attend their kid's soccer games while simultaneously criticizing you for leaving at 5:30 for your own family obligations.

**"Self-starter"**
TRANSLATION: Management doesn't actually manage. You'll be left to your own devices with no direction, and then blamed when you don't read their minds correctly about priorities.

**"Opportunity for growth"**
TRANSLATION: We're not paying you enough now, but maybe someday! (Not someday. There's no budget. We've been saying this to employees for six years.)

**"Results-oriented environment"**
TRANSLATION: We judge you exclusively on outcomes while giving you no control over resources, timeline, or strategy. When things inevitably go wrong due to factors outside your control, we'll blame you personally.

**"Open to remote work"**
TRANSLATION: Grudgingly allowing it because we have to compete for talent, but we'll resent you for it. Your fully-remote colleagues will mysteriously never get promoted. What a coincidence!

**"Customer-focused culture"**
TRANSLATION: Customers can treat you like garbage and you must smile through it. "The customer is always right" is taken literally here, even when they're objectively, provably wrong.

**"Seeking passionate candidates"**
TRANSLATION: We're going to underpay you and expect unpaid overtime, but if you do it with enough enthusiasm, that's basically the same as fair compensation, right?

**"Startup environment"**
TRANSLATION: Chaos. Pure, unfiltered chaos. We have one successful product and 47 half-finished ideas. Your job description will change monthly. Half the company might get laid off next quarter. But there's a ping-pong table!

**"Detail-oriented"**
TRANSLATION: Your boss is a micromanager who will critique the font size in your emails and spend 45 minutes debating comma placement in a memo that three people will read.

**"Must be comfortable with ambiguity"**
TRANSLATION: We literally don't know what we're doing. Like, at all. We're making this up as we go. You're supposed to magically know what we want despite us not knowing what we want. Good luck!

**"Rockstar"/"Ninja"/"Wizard"**
TRANSLATION: We're trying way too hard to seem cool and fun. This job is probably neither cool nor fun. We definitely have some cringe team-building activities planned that everyone secretly hates.

**"Able to work under pressure"**
TRANSLATION: Everything is an emergency because we don't plan ahead. Poor planning on our part becomes your crisis on a daily basis. You'll develop stress-related health issues within 18 months.

**"Must be proficient in [37 different software platforms]"**
TRANSLATION: We don't actually use 31 of these. We just copied requirements from another job posting and added a few tools we saw mentioned on LinkedIn.

## Why This Happens

Here's the thing: [HR teams are trying to make positions sound appealing while hiding the red flags](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-description-red-flags). [Hiring managers want a unicorn who'll do the impossible for peanuts](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/unrealistic-job-requirements). And everyone's terrified of being honest because they think transparency will scare away candidates.

But you know what actually scares away candidates? [Getting hired based on misleading job descriptions and discovering the reality is completely different](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/misleading-job-descriptions/). That leads to quick turnover, bad Glassdoor reviews, and a damaged employer brand.

## The Solution Nobody Will Implement

Just. Be. Honest.

"This is a demanding role with tight deadlines. You'll need to manage multiple priorities in an environment where things change quickly. We're offering $X because that's our budget. If you're someone who thrives on variety and can handle pressure well, you might love this. If you need stability and clear processes, this probably isn't the right fit."

See? Not that hard. You filter for people who actually want what you're offering, instead of attracting people who feel misled two weeks into the job.

But will companies do this? [Absolutely not](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2024/10/08/job-posting-honesty/). They'll keep using euphemisms and wondering why they can't retain anyone.

And we'll keep translating.
