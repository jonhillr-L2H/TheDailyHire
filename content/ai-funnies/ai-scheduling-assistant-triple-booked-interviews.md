I hate scheduling interviews.

The endless email chains. "Are you available Tuesday at 2?" "No, but Wednesday at 3 works." "Wednesday is bad for the hiring manager. How about Thursday at 1?" "I have a conflict. Can we do Friday?"

**It takes DAYS to schedule ONE interview.**

So I bought an AI scheduling assistant.

**The promise:** "Automate interview scheduling. The AI finds times that work for everyone and books them automatically. No more back-and-forth."

**What actually happened:** The AI triple-booked every time slot, scheduled interviews on weekends, put candidates in the wrong time zones, and created a scheduling apocalypse involving 47 very angry people.

## How It Was Supposed To Work

The AI scheduling tool integrates with my calendar.

**The process:**
1. I add a candidate to the system
2. The AI scans my calendar for available times
3. The AI sends the candidate a scheduling link
4. The candidate picks a time
5. The AI books it automatically

**Simple. Elegant. No human intervention required.**

## What Actually Happened

### Week One: Everything Seemed Fine

I added 12 candidates to the system.

The AI sent them all scheduling links.

They picked times.

Interviews got booked.

**I thought: "This is amazing. Why didn't I do this sooner?"**

### Week Two: The Triple-Booking Incident

Monday morning, I checked my calendar.

**9:00 AM: Interview with Sarah Martinez**
**9:00 AM: Interview with James Chen**
**9:00 AM: Interview with Patricia Williams**

Three people. Same time slot.

"Okay," I thought. "The AI made a mistake. I'll fix it."

I checked the rest of my week.

**Tuesday 10:00 AM:** 4 interviews booked
**Tuesday 2:00 PM:** 3 interviews booked
**Wednesday 11:00 AM:** 5 interviews booked
**Thursday 3:00 PM:** 2 interviews booked

**Every. Single. Time. Slot. Was. Double or triple-booked.**

The AI had interpreted "find available times" as "book everyone during every available slot."

### The Apology Tour Begins

I had to email 23 candidates explaining that their interviews were canceled and we needed to reschedule.

**Email I sent:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm very sorry, but due to a scheduling error, your interview on [Date] at [Time] has been canceled. Our scheduling system double-booked several time slots.
>
> I apologize for the inconvenience. Please use this link to reschedule at your convenience.
>
> Thank you for your understanding.

**Responses I got:**

**Candidate 1:** "I took time off work for this interview. This is unprofessional."

**Candidate 2:** "I rearranged my entire day. Can you not manage a calendar?"

**Candidate 3:** "I'm withdrawing my application. If you can't schedule an interview properly, I don't trust your company to function."

**Fair.**

## Week Three: The AI Schedules A Weekend Interview (That I Miss)

I thought I'd fixed the problem by manually reviewing the AI's bookings before they were confirmed.

But the AI had a "auto-confirm" setting I didn't know existed.

**Saturday, 10:00 AM:**

My phone started ringing.

I was at a farmer's market. I ignored it.

It rang again. And again.

I checked. **Unknown number.**

Then I got an email.

**Subject:** "Where are you???"

**From:** A candidate I was supposed to interview.

**Body:**

> I'm on the Zoom call for my interview. You're not here. Did I get the time wrong?

I checked my calendar.

**Saturday, 10:00 AM: Interview with Marcus Johnson**

THE AI SCHEDULED AN INTERVIEW ON A SATURDAY.

I called Marcus immediately.

**Me:** "Marcus, I am SO sorry. The scheduling system made an error. I didn't realize an interview was booked for Saturday."

**Marcus:** "I cleared my Saturday morning for this."

**Me:** "I know. This is entirely my fault. Can we reschedule for Monday?"

**Marcus:** "Honestly, this has been such a mess. I'm going to pass on this opportunity."

**Me:** "I completely understand."

And that's how an AI cost us a great candidate.

## Week Four: The 3 AM Interview Invitation

**Subject:** "Interview Invitation - 3:00 AM EST"

I stared at my email in disbelief.

The AI had sent a candidate an interview invitation for **3:00 AM on a Tuesday.**

I immediately emailed the candidate.

**Me:** "Please disregard that interview invitation. There was a system error. Obviously we're not interviewing anyone at 3 AM."

**Candidate:** "I was very confused."

**Me:** "So am I."

**I checked the AI logs.**

Apparently, the candidate was in California (PST). I'm in New York (EST).

The AI tried to find a time that worked for both of us.

It found **12:00 AM PST (my time zone) = 3:00 AM EST.**

The AI thought midnight was a reasonable interview time.

**Technically, my calendar was "available" at midnight. Because I was asleep.**

The AI didn't understand that "available" meant "awake and working," not just "no calendar conflicts."

## Week Five: The Email Flood

One candidate received **14 interview invitations** for the same role.

**All different times. All from the AI. All within 24 hours.**

She forwarded them all to me with one line:

**"What is happening?"**

I had no answer.

The AI had gotten stuck in a loop. Every time she didn't respond to an invitation within 2 hours, it assumed she wasn't interested in that time and sent a new invitation.

**14 invitations later, she thought we were either incompetent or insane.**

## Why The AI Failed So Spectacularly

I called the AI scheduling tool's support team.

**Me:** "Your AI is scheduling interviews at 3 AM, triple-booking time slots, and spamming candidates with duplicate invitations."

**Support:** "Let me check your settings."

*10 minutes of hold music*

**Support:** "Okay, I see the problem."

**Me:** "What is it?"

**Support:** "You didn't set working hours."

**Me:** "What?"

**Support:** "The AI defaults to 'all hours are available unless blocked.' You need to manually set your working hours in the settings."

**Me:** "Why would ANYONE want interviews scheduled at 3 AM?"

**Support:** "Some users work internationally across time zones."

**Me:** "But I'm not one of them."

**Support:** "Right. You need to set that manually."

**Me:** "And the triple-booking?"

**Support:** "You enabled 'maximize scheduling efficiency mode.'"

**Me:** "What does that mean?"

**Support:** "The AI tries to book as many interviews as possible in the shortest time frame."

**Me:** "By booking three people at the same time?"

**Support:** "The AI assumes you can handle multiple interviews simultaneously if they're short."

**Me:** "They're 45-minute interviews."

**Support:** "Oh. That won't work then."

**Me:** "No. It did not."

## The Settings I Didn't Know Existed

Apparently, the AI had dozens of settings buried in a "preferences" menu I never opened.

**Settings I should have configured but didn't:**
- Working hours (default: 24/7)
- Maximum interviews per day (default: unlimited)
- Buffer time between interviews (default: 0 minutes)
- Time zone handling (default: "auto-detect" which didn't actually work)
- Auto-confirm (default: ON)
- Candidate follow-up (default: send reminders every 2 hours until they respond)

**I had activated an AI with zero guardrails.**

It was like giving a toddler a flamethrower and being surprised when things caught fire.

## I Turned Off The AI

I disabled the AI scheduling assistant.

Back to manual scheduling.

**Yes, it takes longer.**

**Yes, it's annoying.**

**But at least I'm not scheduling interviews at 3 AM or triple-booking time slots.**

## The Fallout

**Out of 47 candidates I tried to schedule with the AI:**
- 12 withdrew their applications (citing unprofessionalism)
- 18 rescheduled manually (after I apologized profusely)
- 9 never responded again (presumably moved on)
- 8 completed interviews (despite the chaos)

**We hired 2 people from that disaster of a cohort.**

Both of them joked about it in their interviews.

**Candidate:** "I heard your scheduling system is... interesting."

**Me:** "We've since returned to doing things manually like it's 2015."

**Candidate:** "Good choice."

## The Lesson

AI scheduling tools can work—but only if you:

1. **Set working hours explicitly** (don't assume the AI knows you sleep)
2. **Disable auto-confirm** (review bookings before they go out)
3. **Set buffer times** (humans need breaks between interviews)
4. **Test it with ONE candidate** before unleashing it on 50 people
5. **Monitor it constantly** (AI doesn't know when it's screwing up)

**Or—and hear me out—just schedule interviews manually.**

It takes 5 extra minutes per interview.

But you won't triple-book time slots, schedule weekend interviews, or send candidates 14 duplicate invitations.

**Sometimes the old way is the better way.**

(And if you're one of the 47 candidates I traumatized with AI scheduling chaos: I'm sorry. We're better now. Probably.)
