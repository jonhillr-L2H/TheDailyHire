Every year, millions of interviews waste time asking questions that reveal nothing about whether someone can do the job. Candidates give rehearsed answers. Interviewers nod thoughtfully. Everyone pretends useful information was exchanged.

[Here are the worst offenders and why you should stop asking them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/worst-interview-questions).

## "Tell Me About Yourself"

**What you think you're learning:** How candidates present themselves and prioritize information.

**What you're actually learning:** How well they memorized their rehearsed intro.

Every single candidate has prepared for this question. [They've been told to deliver a 60-second elevator pitch](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question/) that summarizes their background in a compelling narrative arc.

You're not assessing their communication skills. You're assessing their ability to follow extremely common interview advice.

**What to ask instead:** "Walk me through a recent project you worked on—what was the goal, what did you do, and what was the outcome?"

Now they have to talk about something specific without a script.

## "What's Your Greatest Weakness?"

**What you think you're learning:** Self-awareness and growth mindset.

**What you're actually learning:** Which weakness-that's-secretly-a-strength they chose from the internet.

[Everyone knows the game](https://www.themuse.com/advice/greatest-weakness-interview-question). "I'm a perfectionist." "I care too much." "I work too hard." These aren't real weaknesses—they're humble brags disguised as vulnerability.

And if someone gives you an actual weakness? You're going to hold it against them. We all know it.

**What to ask instead:** "Tell me about a time you made a mistake at work. What happened and what did you learn?"

Forces them to be specific instead of performing false modesty.

## "Where Do You See Yourself In Five Years?"

**What you think you're learning:** Career goals and ambition.

**What you're actually learning:** How well they can lie about planning to stay at your company long-term.

[Nobody knows where they'll be in five years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/career-planning-myth/). The world changes too fast. Career paths are non-linear. And yet we keep asking this question.

The candidate who says "Right here, growing with your company!" is either lying or has no ambition. The candidate who gives a real answer ("I want to be a VP at a bigger company") just disqualified themselves.

Nobody wins.

**What to ask instead:** "What skills do you want to develop in your next role?"

Same intent, but focused on growth rather than performative loyalty.

## "Why Should We Hire You?"

**What you think you're learning:** How they position themselves and sell their value.

**What you're actually learning:** Nothing you didn't already learn from the resume and previous questions.

This question exists so interviewers can sit back and make candidates pitch themselves. [It's lazy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-should-we-hire-you-terrible-question/).

Plus, the candidate doesn't have enough information to answer well. They don't know what other candidates you're considering or what specific problem you're trying to solve.

**What to ask instead:** "Based on what you know about this role, what aspects do you think you'd excel at and what would be more challenging?"

Forces self-assessment without the awkward sales pitch.

## "What's Your Dream Job?"

**What you think you're learning:** Whether this role aligns with their goals.

**What you're actually learning:** Whether they're smart enough to say "This one!"

[This is a trap question](https://www.themuse.com/advice/dream-job-interview-question). If they describe something different from your role, you'll assume they're not really interested. If they say "this role is my dream job," you'll assume they're lying.

**What to ask instead:** Skip this entirely. It's useless.

## "If You Were An Animal, What Would You Be?"

**What you think you're learning:** Creativity and personality.

**What you're actually learning:** How uncomfortable you can make someone in an interview.

[These "creative" questions are supposed to catch candidates off guard and reveal their true personality](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/creative-interview-questions-waste-time). In reality, they just make you look unserious.

"I'd be a dolphin because I'm intelligent and work well in teams!" Cool. Dolphins also assault other sea creatures. Is that relevant to the role? No? Then why are we talking about this?

**What to ask instead:** Literally any question about their actual work experience.

## "What's Your Biggest Accomplishment?"

**What you think you're learning:** What they're capable of achieving.

**What you're actually learning:** Which accomplishment they rehearsed.

This question is too broad. [Personal accomplishment? Professional? Recent? Ever?](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/biggest-accomplishment-interview-question/) Candidates don't know what you're looking for, so they guess.

And the accomplishment they choose might be completely irrelevant to your role. "I ran a marathon!" Great. This is a data analyst position.

**What to ask instead:** "Tell me about a time you solved a complex problem at work. What was the situation, what did you do, and what was the result?"

Specific, work-focused, and actionable.

## "Why Do You Want To Work Here?"

**What you think you're learning:** Whether they researched your company and are genuinely interested.

**What you're actually learning:** How well they can pretend to be excited about your company's mission statement.

[Every candidate has looked at your website and can parrot back your "About Us" page](https://www.themuse.com/advice/why-do-you-want-to-work-here-interview). "I'm passionate about your mission to democratize access to cloud-based enterprise solutions!" No they're not. They want a job.

The real answer is usually "I need money and your role matches my skills." But they can't say that, so they perform enthusiasm instead.

**What to ask instead:** "What about this role specifically interested you?"

Shifts focus from company worship to actual job fit.

## "What Are Your Salary Expectations?"

**What you think you're learning:** Whether you can afford them.

**What you're actually learning:** Who's willing to lowball themselves.

[This question exists so companies can underpay people](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/compensation/salary-expectations-question-problems). If the candidate names a number lower than your budget, you save money. If they name a number higher, you can reject them without revealing your range.

It's information asymmetry disguised as a reasonable question.

**What to ask instead:** Tell them your range upfront. "This role pays between $X and $Y depending on experience. Does that work for you?"

Wild concept: just be transparent.

## "Do You Have Any Questions For Us?"

**What you think you're learning:** Whether they're engaged and curious.

**What you're actually learning:** Nothing, because they're asking the same five questions every candidate asks.

"What does a typical day look like?"
"What's the team structure?"
"What are the next steps?"
"What do you like most about working here?"

[These are fine questions, but they're not revealing](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interview-questions-candidates-should-ask/). Every candidate with basic interview prep asks them.

**What to do instead:** Actually answer their questions honestly instead of giving PR-approved responses. That reveals more about culture than their question does.

## "Why Did You Leave Your Last Job?"

**What you think you're learning:** Whether they're a problem employee.

**What you're actually learning:** How well they can navigate a trap question.

[If they say anything negative about their previous employer, you'll think they're difficult](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/why-did-you-leave-your-last-job/). If they give a generic answer like "seeking new challenges," you'll think they're hiding something.

There's no good answer to this question because it's designed to create suspicion.

**What to ask instead:** "What are you looking for in your next role that you weren't getting in your previous one?"

Same information, but framed positively instead of defensively.

## "How Do You Handle Stress?"

**What you think you're learning:** Whether they can handle pressure.

**What you're actually learning:** Absolutely nothing.

[Nobody says "I handle stress poorly."](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-do-you-handle-stress-interview-question) Everyone says some version of "I stay calm, prioritize tasks, and communicate effectively."

You're getting a rehearsed answer to a predictable question. Zero useful information.

**What to ask instead:** "Tell me about a time you were under significant deadline pressure. How did you manage it?"

Forces a specific example instead of a generic claim.

## "What Motivates You?"

**What you think you're learning:** What drives them professionally.

**What you're actually learning:** Which motivation sounds most acceptable.

The real answer is often "money, avoiding unemployment, and not being bored." But candidates can't say that, so they perform passion: "I'm motivated by solving challenging problems and making an impact!"

[Everyone gives the same answer](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-motivates-you-interview-question/).

**What to ask instead:** "What kind of work energizes you versus drains you?"

Gets at the same information but with more honesty.

## "Describe Your Work Style"

**What you think you're learning:** Whether they'll fit your culture.

**What you're actually learning:** Which work style they think you want to hear.

[This question is too vague to be useful](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/describe-your-work-style-interview/). "I'm collaborative but also independent, detail-oriented but also big-picture focused, structured but also flexible."

They're hedging every answer because they don't know what you want.

**What to ask instead:** "Do you prefer working on long-term projects or shorter, fast-paced tasks? Why?"

Forces them to choose instead of giving you every possible answer.

## The Bottom Line

Stop asking questions where:
- Candidates can easily prepare scripted answers
- There's a "right answer" everyone knows
- The question is too vague to reveal anything useful
- You're testing interview prep skills instead of job skills

[Start asking questions that require specific examples, reveal actual thinking, and relate directly to the work they'll be doing](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/behavioral-interview-questions-that-work).

Your interviews will be more useful. Candidates will appreciate not performing the same tired script. And you might actually learn whether someone can do the job.
