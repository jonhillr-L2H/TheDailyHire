AI is revolutionizing recruiting! It's making everything faster, smarter, and more efficient! Except when it comes to writing job descriptions, where it's somehow producing requirements that make even less sense than the human-written disasters we've endured for years.

Let me share my favorite recent example: an AI-generated job posting for an "Entry-Level Senior Developer" requiring 8+ years of experience in a technology that's existed for 3 years. The future is here, and it's somehow dumber than the past.

## The AI Prompt That Broke Reality

[Companies are now feeding AI tools prompts like "write a job description for a senior developer role"](https://www.ere.net/ai-job-descriptions-problems/) without any other context, then copy-pasting whatever the AI spits out directly into their ATS. No editing. No sanity checking. Just pure, unfiltered AI nonsense.

**What they asked for:** Entry-level marketing coordinator

**What AI generated:**
- Minimum 7 years of experience required
- Must be expert in 15 different marketing platforms (most of which compete with each other)
- PhD preferred but not required (for a coordinator role)
- Must have experience "scaling multi-million dollar marketing campaigns" (for a $45K/year position)
- Fluent in 4 languages, including one that AI apparently invented

One of these requirements is fake. Can you guess which one? Trick question—they're all real, and they're all in actual job postings right now.

## The Classic: Experience Requirements That Defy Physics

[AI job description generators have a weird obsession with time travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/ai_job_descriptions/). They're constantly asking for more years of experience than a technology has existed.

**Recent AI-generated gems:**

"Seeking candidate with 10+ years of experience in ChatGPT implementation and optimization"
- ChatGPT launched in November 2022. So unless you've got access to a DeLorean and a flux capacitor, this one's a hard pass.

"Minimum 6 years hands-on experience with Claude AI required"
- Claude launched in 2023. The AI is writing job descriptions requiring more experience with itself than is physically possible. That's either meta or just deeply confused.

"Must have 8+ years experience with GPT-4 fine-tuning and deployment"
- GPT-4 came out in March 2023. But sure, let's just pretend 2025 minus 2023 equals 8. Math is hard for AI, apparently.

[This isn't occasional. It's systematic](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/ai-job-posting-errors). The AI doesn't understand timelines, so it just suggests "experience requirements" that sound professional without checking if they're physically possible.

## The Skill List Generated by Someone Who Learned About Jobs From LinkedIn

[AI job description tools love to create "comprehensive" skill requirements by throwing every keyword into a blender](https://textio.com/blog/ai-job-descriptions-problems). The result reads like a LinkedIn profile that gained sentience and achieved delusions of grandeur.

**Actual AI-generated requirements from a single job posting:**
- Proficient in Salesforce, HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp, Constant Contact, and Klaviyo (that's 8 marketing automation platforms, most companies use ONE)
- Expert in Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Heap (5 different analytics platforms)
- Advanced skills in Excel, Google Sheets, Airtable, Notion, Monday.com, Asana, ClickUp, and Smartsheet (why would you need 8 project management tools?)

[Nobody has ever had this combination of skills](https://www.ere.net/unrealistic-job-requirements/). This isn't a job description—it's a software vendor wish list written by an AI that thinks more tools = more qualified.

## The Salary Range Written by Someone Who's Never Seen Money

My absolute favorite AI job description failures are the salary ranges that make you wonder if the AI understands how human currency works.

**Recent examples:**

"Salary range: $45,000 - $250,000 depending on experience"
- That's not a range. That's a roulette wheel. What experience level takes you from entry-level to executive compensation? Does the job title change halfway through?

"Competitive salary (Confidential)"
- The AI learned that companies hide salaries, so it generated a placeholder that explicitly says it's hiding the salary. Thanks for the honesty about the dishonesty, I guess?

"Compensation: $competitive"
- Yes, the AI literally put "$competitive" as the salary amount. It read enough job descriptions to know salaries should be "competitive" but didn't understand that's an adjective, not a number.

[Salary transparency laws are now in effect in multiple states](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/compensation/state-salary-transparency-laws-2025), but AI job description tools are producing ranges so wide they're technically compliant while being completely useless.

## When AI Writes the "Culture" Section

[AI-generated culture sections read like they were written by an algorithm that learned about company culture from LinkedIn influencer posts](https://www.fastcompany.com/90892341/linkedin-is-cringe-and-why-we-cant-stop-using-it).

**What AI thinks company culture is:**

"We're a dynamic, fast-paced startup environment with a passion for innovation and disruption. We work hard and play hard. We're a family that values collaboration, thinking outside the box, and moving the needle. We're looking for rockstars who thrive in ambiguity and aren't afraid to fail fast and break things."

Translation: "We don't have a real culture, so we asked AI to generate buzzwords. Also, we definitely have a ping pong table that nobody uses."

[Every single sentence in that paragraph is a red flag](https://www.askamanager.org/2025/09/job-posting-red-flags.html), but AI thinks it sounds professional because these phrases appear in thousands of job descriptions. The AI doesn't know they're meaningless—it just knows they're common.

## The Requirements Section That Forgot What Job It's Writing For

Here's where AI job descriptions get truly surreal: the AI forgets what role it's describing and starts adding requirements from completely different jobs.

**Real example from an "Administrative Assistant" posting:**
- Proficiency in Python and SQL required
- Experience with machine learning models preferred
- Must be comfortable with cloud infrastructure management
- Blockchain knowledge a plus
- Oh, and also you need to answer phones and schedule meetings

[Somewhere in the training data, "assistant" got mixed up with "data engineer,"](https://www.ere.net/ai-recruiting-mistakes/) and now administrative candidates need to know blockchain. Makes perfect sense!

## The Benefits Section Written by an AI That's Never Had a Job

AI-generated benefits sections are particularly hilarious because they list perks that sound good but are either standard (not perks) or meaningless.

**Common AI-generated "benefits":**

- "Competitive salary" (that's not a benefit, that's literally the compensation)
- "Health insurance" (legally required for companies over 50 employees)
- "Opportunity for growth" (translation: we don't have a promotion plan)
- "Dynamic work environment" (translation: chaos)
- "Unlimited PTO" (translation: toxic culture where nobody takes PTO)
- "Free snacks" (the AI thinks this matters; it doesn't)

[What candidates actually want: Remote flexibility, clear career paths, and real work-life balance](https://commonwealthjoe.com/blogs/blog/top-office-perks). What AI offers: Ping pong tables and "growth opportunities."

## Why This Keeps Happening

[Companies are using AI to save time on job description writing](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/topics/hr-recruiting-strategy), which makes sense in theory. But they're skipping the "edit and verify" step, which means nonsensical requirements go live because nobody's actually reading them.

The AI is trained on thousands of existing job descriptions—many of which were already poorly written by humans. So the AI learned to replicate common patterns (asking for unrealistic experience, listing contradictory requirements, using meaningless buzzwords) without understanding why those patterns are bad.

[It's garbage in, garbage out, but automated at scale](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/ai-bias-recruiting).

## The Solution (Besides Not Using AI for Everything)

If you're going to use AI to write job descriptions, here's a wild idea: **Read what the AI generates and fix the obviously broken parts before posting it.**

**Checklist before publishing:**
- ✅ Do the experience requirements exceed the age of the technology?
- ✅ Are we asking for skills that only 12 people on Earth possess?
- ✅ Does the salary range span from "intern" to "C-suite"?
- ✅ Did we list benefits that are actually benefits?
- ✅ Do the requirements match the actual job title?

If you answered "yes" to any of these, **edit the damn description** before posting it.

## The Bottom Line

AI job description generators are producing requirements that make human-written job descriptions look reasonable by comparison. We've automated incompetence and convinced ourselves it's innovation.

[The tools aren't the problem—the problem is using them without human review](https://textio.com/blog/ai-job-descriptions-best-practices). AI can draft. Humans should edit. Otherwise, you end up asking for 10 years of experience in a 3-year-old technology, and wondering why qualified candidates aren't applying.

Spoiler: They're too busy laughing at your job posting on Reddit.

**Key Takeaways:**

- AI job description generators produce nonsensical requirements
- Common errors: impossible experience timelines, contradictory skills, absurd salary ranges
- AI trained on bad human job descriptions, learned to replicate the same mistakes
- "Entry-level" roles requiring "senior" experience are AI-generated classics
- Solution: Actually read and edit AI-generated content before publishing
- Or keep posting jobs asking for 8 years of experience with GPT-4 and wonder why nobody applies
