# Recruiter Accidentally Views Candidate's Profile 47 Times, Gets Notification For Each One

A technical recruiter in Seattle spent her entire Monday researching a promising candidate's LinkedIn profile, forgetting one crucial detail: her LinkedIn premium account wasn't in private viewing mode. The candidate received 47 separate "Sarah M. viewed your profile" notifications throughout the day, creating what he described as "the most aggressive recruiting energy I've ever experienced."

The viewing history tells a story of increasing desperation: 8:47 AM (initial view), 8:53 AM (checking again), 9:12 AM (probably showing to hiring manager), 11:34 AM (viewing mutual connections), 2:47 PM (reading every single recommendation), and then approximately 30 more views spread across the afternoon that can only be described as "profile refresh anxiety."

## The Notification Bombardment

The candidate, a senior DevOps engineer who was passively looking but not actively applying, reported his phone buzzing constantly starting around 9 AM. "At first I thought maybe it was a bug," he said in a Reddit post that's currently trending on r/recruitinghell. "Then I realized someone was just... really, really interested in my profile. Like, concerningly interested."

By noon, he'd started screenshot-ing each notification and sending them to his group chat with the caption "I think I have a stalker." His friends suggested he either block the recruiter or marry her, depending on whether the job was any good.

## The Panicked Realization

According to sources familiar with the situation (her mortified LinkedIn post apologizing), the recruiter realized her mistake around 3 PM when a colleague asked why she was "viewing the same profile every 10 minutes." The blood reportedly drained from her face as she checked her settings and discovered private mode had been turned off since last week.

Her immediate response was to send a LinkedIn message saying "Hi! I noticed we viewed each other's profiles and wanted to reach out about an opportunity." The candidate responded: "You viewed my profile 47 times. I viewed yours once to figure out who was stalking me. These are not the same."

## The Recruiter InMail

Undeterred by the awkwardness, the recruiter sent a follow-up InMail with the subject line "I promise I'm not a stalker (just very thorough)." The message acknowledged the "enthusiastic profile viewing" and tried to play it off as "deep research into cultural fit."

The candidate, who was initially annoyed, admitted the honesty was "kind of refreshing compared to the usual copy-paste garbage" and agreed to a call. They're now in final round interviews, though he's requested she "please use private mode when inevitably checking my profile 50 more times before the interview."

## LinkedIn's New Feature Idea

The incident has sparked discussions on LinkedIn about whether the platform should add a "You've viewed this profile X times today" warning for recruiters. LinkedIn's product team reportedly replied "we assumed people would notice but clearly we overestimated human awareness."

Other recruiters chimed in with their own horror stories: viewing a candidate's profile while sitting next to them in an interview, accidentally liking a 5-year-old post at 2 AM, and the classic "sending a connection request to someone you just rejected."

## New Best Practice Unlocked

The recruiter has since posted a thread of "lessons learned" including: 1) Always check private mode before stalking, 2) Maybe don't view the same profile 47 times in one day even in private mode, and 3) If you do accidentally stalk someone, own it immediately instead of pretending it didn't happen.

The candidate updated his LinkedIn headline to include "(Sarah M. approved)" which is either the beginning of a beautiful working relationship or the most passive-aggressive flex in recruiting history.

Recruiting experts suggest this is exactly why LinkedIn Premium exists, though one commenter noted "imagine paying $80/month for LinkedIn and STILL forgetting to turn on the one feature that prevents you from looking like a creep."

*All profile views in this story were definitely intentional and not at all the result of obsessive tab-refreshing. Probably.*
