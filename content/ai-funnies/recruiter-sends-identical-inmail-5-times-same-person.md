We've all received those generic recruiter InMails. [You know the ones: "I came across your profile and think you'd be perfect for an exciting opportunity at [Company]"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/generic-recruiter-inmails-examples/) with zero indication they actually read your profile.

But receiving the **exact same InMail from the same recruiter five times in two weeks**? That's a new level of lazy recruiting that deserves recognition.

## The Messages

[A software engineer posted screenshots on LinkedIn showing five identical InMails from the same recruiter, sent over a 14-day period](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/engineer-recruiter-spam-story/):

**October 28: "Hi [Name], I came across your profile and was impressed by your background in software development..."**

**November 2: "Hi [Name], I came across your profile and was impressed by your background in software development..."** [Word-for-word identical]

**November 6: "Hi [Name], I came across your profile and was impressed by your background in software development..."** [Still identical]

**November 9: "Hi [Name], I came across your profile and was impressed by your background in software development..."** [Yep, same one]

**November 11: "Hi [Name], I came across your profile and was impressed by your background in software development..."** [At this point it's performance art]

[Each message was sent from the same recruiter at the same agency](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/five_identical_inmails/). [Each promised an "exciting opportunity" at a "fast-growing tech company"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/generic-recruiter-messaging-patterns-2025). [Each asked to "schedule a quick call to discuss further"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-inmail-template-overuse-2025).

[None acknowledged that they'd already sent the exact same message four times before](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-messaging-tracking-failures-2025/).

## The Candidate's Response

After the third identical InMail, the candidate responded:

**"This is the third time you've sent me this exact message. Are you okay? Should I be concerned?"**

[No response from the recruiter](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiter-ghosting-candidates-2025/).

After the fifth InMail, the candidate had enough:

**"You've now sent me the same message five times. I'm documenting this and posting it. This is absurd."**

[Still no response](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-candidate-communication-failures/).

[So the candidate kept their promise and posted the entire screenshot thread on LinkedIn with the caption](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiter-spam-exposed-2025/): **"Tell me you're using mass InMail automation without telling me you're using mass InMail automation."**

**It went viral.** [12,000+ reactions, 3,000+ comments, shared across Twitter, Reddit, and recruiting forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/viral_inmail_disaster/).

## The Recruiter's Defense (Or Lack Thereof)

[The recruiting agency initially didn't respond](https://www.hrdive.com/news/viral-recruiting-disaster-response-failures/). [Then, after the post hit critical mass, they issued a vague statement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiting-agency-damage-control-2025/):

**"We apologize for any inconvenience caused by automated messaging. We're reviewing our outreach processes to ensure better candidate experience."**

[Translation: "We got caught using spray-and-pray InMail automation and didn't monitor what was being sent or to whom"](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-automation-oversight-failures-2025).

[The recruiter who sent the messages never commented publicly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-accountability-viral-mistakes/). [Their LinkedIn profile went private shortly after the post went viral](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiter-profile-privacy-settings-damage-control/).

## How This Happens

[This isn't a one-off mistake—it's a system failure that reveals how some recruiting agencies operate](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-automation-quality-control-2025/):

**Mass InMail tools without deduplication**: [Recruiting automation platforms allow bulk messaging](https://www.talenttech.com/recruiter-automation-tools-2025/). [If you upload a list of 500 profiles and send the same template to all of them without checking for duplicates, people on multiple lists get multiple messages](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/inmail-deduplication-failures-2025).

**No CRM tracking**: [Proper recruiting CRMs track all candidate interactions](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiting-crm-tracking-best-practices-2025). [They show message history, prevent duplicate outreach, and flag when you've already contacted someone](https://www.hrdive.com/news/crm-duplicate-contact-prevention/). [This agency clearly wasn't using one—or was ignoring it](https://www.talentculture.com/recruiting-crm-adoption-failures/).

**High-volume, low-quality approach**: [Some agencies prioritize quantity over quality](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-volume-vs-quality-strategies/). [Send 1,000 InMails, hope for 20 responses, don't worry about the 980 who ignore you or the duplicates](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/spray-and-pray-recruiting-effectiveness-2025). [This candidate just got unlucky and appeared on their lists five times](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-list-management-failures/).

**Overworked recruiters**: [Individual recruiters managing 40-50 reqs simultaneously don't have time to personalize messages](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-workload-message-quality/). [They rely on templates and automation to hit activity metrics](https://www.talentculture.com/recruiting-metrics-vs-quality-outcomes/). [Sending five duplicates means they met their "outreach target" five times](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiting-activity-metrics-dysfunction/).

## The LinkedIn Comments

[The post generated thousands of comments, mostly from frustrated candidates sharing similar experiences](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiter-spam-shared-experiences/):

**"I've received the same template from three different recruiters at the same agency. They don't even talk to each other."**

**"My favorite is when they send 'I saw your experience at [Previous Company]'...a company I left four years ago and isn't even on my profile anymore."**

**"I once responded to a recruiter's third identical InMail asking if they'd had a stroke. They blocked me."**

**"The 'I came across your profile' line is insulting when it's obvious you ran a Boolean search and bulk-messaged 500 people."**

**"This is why candidates ghost recruiters. You treat us like we're disposable, we treat you the same way."**

[Recruiters also chimed in, mostly with embarrassment](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/viral_inmail_reaction_from_recruiters/):

**"This is why our industry has a terrible reputation. This recruiter makes us all look bad."**

**"Anyone using mass InMail without deduplication and tracking deserves to get roasted."**

**"I've seen agencies where recruiters hit 'send' on automated campaigns without reviewing who's on the list. It's pure laziness."**

## The Bigger Problem

[This incident is a symptom of how recruiting has been industrialized and depersonalized](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-industrialization-candidate-experience-2025):

[Recruiting agencies operate on volume metrics](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiting-agency-business-model-dysfunction/). [Recruiters are evaluated on InMails sent, calls made, candidates submitted](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-metrics-quality-disconnect/). [Not quality of relationships, response rates, or candidate satisfaction](https://www.talentculture.com/recruiting-performance-metrics-evolution/).

[Automation makes it easy to send 100 InMails per day](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/recruiting-automation-scale-vs-quality/). [It also makes it easy to send the same 100 InMails five times to the same people if you're not paying attention](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-automation-oversight-requirements/).

[Candidates are treated as leads in a sales funnel, not humans with careers and goals](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/candidate-experience-humanization-challenge/). [Send generic messages, see who bites, move on if they don't](https://www.talentculture.com/transactional-recruiting-candidate-alienation/).

[The result: recruiting has a reputation problem](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-profession-reputation-crisis-2025). [Candidates don't trust recruiters, don't respond to messages, and publicly shame bad behavior when it goes too far](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-trust-recruiting-industry-decline/).

## What Should Have Happened

Basic recruiting hygiene would have prevented this:

**Use a CRM that tracks candidate interactions**: [Every message sent, every call made, every email should be logged](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/recruiting-crm-implementation-best-practices/). [Before sending an InMail, check if you've contacted them before](https://www.talenttech.com/recruiting-crm-duplicate-prevention-features/).

**Deduplicate candidate lists before bulk outreach**: [If you're using automation, run deduplication before sending](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/candidate-list-deduplication-workflows/). [Remove anyone you've contacted in the past 90 days](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-outreach-frequency-best-practices/).

**Personalize messages**: [Reference something specific from their profile](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/personalized-recruiting-messages-effectiveness/). [Mention a project, a skill, a mutual connection](https://www.talentculture.com/inmail-personalization-response-rates/). [It takes 30 seconds and dramatically improves response rates](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/inmail-personalization-roi-analysis/).

**Monitor outreach campaigns**: [Review who's being contacted and what messages are being sent](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-outreach-quality-control/). [Catch errors before candidates start posting screenshots on LinkedIn](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/recruiting-campaign-monitoring-strategies/).

**Respond when candidates call you out**: [If someone replies saying "you've sent this three times," acknowledge it and apologize](https://www.talentculture.com/recruiter-mistake-recovery-strategies/). [Don't ghost them and hope they forget](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-candidate-communication-repair/).

## The Aftermath

[The candidate's post got enough attention that the recruiting agency's reputation took a visible hit](https://www.hrdive.com/news/viral-recruiting-mistake-brand-damage-measurement/). [Multiple people commented that they'd never work with that agency based on this incident](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiting-agency-reputation-damage-comments/).

[The recruiter who sent the messages apparently no longer works at the agency, though it's unclear if they quit or were fired](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/inmail_recruiter_aftermath/).

[The candidate received dozens of InMails from other recruiters trying to capitalize on their viral post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/viral-post-recruiter-opportunism/). [Several started with "Unlike that other recruiter..."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/competitor-mistake-opportunistic-recruiting/) which is at least slightly more creative than the original template.

## The Lesson

[If you're going to use recruiting automation—and most recruiters should to manage workload—you need proper systems to prevent disasters](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiting-automation-quality-control-framework-2025):

✅ **CRM tracking of all candidate interactions**
✅ **Deduplication before bulk outreach**
✅ **Personalization (even minimal)**
✅ **Response monitoring and error correction**
✅ **Quality metrics, not just volume metrics**

[Otherwise, you're one viral LinkedIn post away from becoming the next recruiting horror story](https://www.hrdive.com/news/viral-recruiting-disasters-prevention-strategies-2025/).

**And five identical InMails is definitely horror story territory.**
