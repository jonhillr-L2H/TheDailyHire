Out-of-office messages are supposed to inform people that you're unavailable and provide alternative contacts for urgent matters. They're not supposed to be sent to hundreds of job candidates as automatic responses to their applications. [But that's exactly what happened when a recruiter at a growing SaaS company configured their out-of-office settings incorrectly—resulting in two weeks of candidates receiving vacation updates instead of interview scheduling emails](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/out-of-office-candidate-disaster-2025/).

The message read: "Thanks for your email! I'm out of the office from Nov 4-18 enjoying some much-needed vacation time in Costa Rica. I'll have limited email access but will respond when I return. For urgent recruiting matters, please contact recruiting@company.com. Pura vida!"

Friendly and informative—exactly what colleagues need to know. Completely inappropriate for job applicants waiting to hear if they got the interview.

## How Nobody Noticed for Two Weeks

[The error happened because of a misconfigured email rule in the recruiter's email client](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/out-of-office-candidate-disaster-2025/). Instead of setting an out-of-office auto-reply for internal emails and known contacts, the recruiter accidentally set it as an auto-reply for ALL incoming emails—including automated messages from their ATS.

[Their ATS was configured to send candidate communications from the recruiter's email address](https://www.greenhouse.io/candidate-communication-email-configuration). When candidates applied or advanced in the pipeline, they'd receive emails from "Sarah.recruiting@company.com" with interview scheduling links, assessment instructions, or follow-up questions.

Except now, every single one of those emails triggered an auto-reply: "Thanks for your email! I'm out of the office... enjoying vacation time in Costa Rica."

[The recruiter was actually on vacation, so they weren't monitoring their email or the candidate pipeline](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiting-out-of-office-fail-2025/). The recruiting coordinator who was supposed to cover wasn't copied on the ATS communications because they came from the recruiter's personal email. Nobody was watching the candidate experience.

For two weeks, candidates received messages like:

**Monday, Nov 6:** "Congratulations! You've advanced to the technical interview round. Please use this Calendly link to schedule your interview: [link]"

**Immediately followed by:** "Thanks for your email! I'm out of the office from Nov 4-18 enjoying some much-needed vacation time in Costa Rica. I'll have limited email access but will respond when I return."

[Candidates were understandably confused](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/company-recruiting-communication-chaos-2025). Did they get the interview or not? Should they schedule it? Is the recruiter going to be available? Why is someone on vacation sending them interview invitations?

## When Candidates Started Complaining

[The error was discovered only when multiple candidates reached out to the generic recruiting email address asking for clarification](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/out-of-office-candidate-discovery-2025/).

One candidate wrote: "I received an interview invitation email followed immediately by an out-of-office message saying the recruiter is in Costa Rica until Nov 18. Should I schedule the interview, or should I wait until they return? I'm confused about next steps."

Another: "I've been emailing back and forth about interview times, and every response I send gets an auto-reply about someone being on vacation. Is this position actually active, or is the hiring process paused?"

A particularly frustrated candidate: "I've received four automated emails about this role—application confirmation, interview invitation, assessment link, and interview reminder—and every single one has triggered an out-of-office reply about Costa Rica. Is anyone actually managing this hiring process?"

[The recruiting coordinator who received these emails immediately checked the ATS and discovered that hundreds of candidates had been receiving the vacation auto-reply for two weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/out-of-office-candidate-disaster-2025/).

Application confirmations: auto-reply about Costa Rica.
Interview scheduling emails: auto-reply about Costa Rica.
Assessment instructions: auto-reply about Costa Rica.
Interview reminders: auto-reply about Costa Rica.

[The coordinator frantically contacted the vacationing recruiter (who, ironically, was in Costa Rica and had limited email access as promised) to explain the situation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/recruiting-out-of-office-fail-2025/).

## The Damage Assessment

[By the time the error was caught and fixed, 347 candidates across 12 open positions had received the out-of-office auto-reply at least once](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-communication-failures-impact-2025). Some had received it multiple times as they moved through pipeline stages or responded to automated emails.

**The candidate experience impact was significant:**

- [23 candidates explicitly withdrew their applications, citing "poor communication" and "unprofessional recruiting process" in their withdrawal messages](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/company-recruiting-communication-chaos-2025)
- [51 candidates missed interview time slots because they were confused about whether they should actually schedule or wait](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/out-of-office-scheduling-chaos-2025/)
- [Dozens posted about the experience on Glassdoor, Reddit, and Blind, damaging the company's employer brand](https://www.teamblind.com/post/company-recruiting-disaster-out-of-office-2025)
- [The company's Glassdoor rating dropped 0.3 stars during the two-week period, with multiple reviews mentioning "disorganized recruiting" and "sent vacation auto-replies instead of interview coordination"](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/company-rating-drop-recruiting-issues-2025)

One Glassdoor review: "Applied for a senior engineering role. Received an interview invitation immediately followed by an auto-reply that the recruiter was on vacation in Costa Rica. Tried to schedule anyway and got more vacation messages. Withdrew my application. If they can't coordinate basic email during hiring, how chaotic is actually working there?"

## The Recruiter's Return

[The recruiter returned from vacation to 847 unread emails, angry messages from hiring managers about missed candidates, and a meeting request from the Head of People titled "We need to talk—URGENT"](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/out-of-office-candidate-disaster-2025/).

"I logged in Monday morning expecting the usual post-vacation email backlog," the recruiter posted in r/recruiting. "Instead I found a disaster. Candidates withdrawing, hiring managers furious about unfilled interview slots, and my manager asking why I sent vacation updates to hundreds of job applicants."

[When they reviewed their email settings, they realized the out-of-office rule had been set to "Reply to all external emails" instead of "Reply to emails from contacts only"](https://support.microsoft.com/outlook-out-of-office-settings-correct-configuration). One checkbox difference. Two weeks of candidate communication chaos.

"I felt sick," the recruiter admitted. "I'd been so focused on getting out-of-office set up before my vacation that I rushed through the configuration. I didn't test it, didn't verify the settings, just assumed it would work correctly."

## The Company's Response

[The company immediately implemented damage control measures](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recovering-from-candidate-communication-failures-2025):

**Sent apology emails to all affected candidates:** [A personalized email from the Head of People acknowledging the error, apologizing for confusion, and offering to re-engage candidates who had withdrawn or missed interviews](https://www.ere.net/candidate-experience-recovery-communication-best-practices/).

**Extended interview scheduling windows:** [Gave candidates who missed slots priority re-scheduling and additional flexibility on interview times](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/interview-scheduling-flexibility-candidate-experience/).

**Implemented new out-of-office protocols:** [Required all recruiters to use standardized out-of-office templates with correct settings, have coverage plans documented, and test auto-reply configuration before activating](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/out-of-office-protocols-recruiting-teams/).

**Separated ATS email addresses from personal recruiting emails:** [Changed ATS configuration so candidate communications came from a shared recruiting email address rather than individual recruiter addresses](https://www.greenhouse.io/candidate-communication-best-practices/). This prevents individual recruiter out-of-office settings from affecting candidate experience.

The recruiter received a formal warning and mandatory training on email management and candidate communication protocols. They kept their job but described the experience as "career-defining in the worst way possible."

## What Other Recruiters Learned

[The story spread through recruiting communities as a cautionary tale about email configuration and candidate communication](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-email-automation-mistakes-to-avoid/):

**Test your out-of-office settings before vacation:** [Send test emails from external addresses to verify your auto-reply only goes to intended recipients](https://support.microsoft.com/testing-out-of-office-replies). Don't assume the settings will work correctly.

**Use shared email addresses for candidate communications:** [ATS-generated emails should come from recruiting@company.com or similar shared addresses, not individual recruiter emails](https://www.greenhouse.io/candidate-communication-email-configuration). This prevents individual recruiters' email settings from disrupting candidate experience.

**Have explicit coverage plans for vacations:** [Document who's covering your roles, how candidates will be managed, and ensure the coverage person has access to all necessary systems](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/recruiter-vacation-coverage-planning/).

**Monitor candidate communication even when out:** [Even if you're on vacation, have someone checking that automated candidate communications are working correctly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-automation-monitoring-best-practices-2025/). This coordinator should have been reviewing ATS-generated emails to catch the error.

**Separate out-of-office for internal vs. external contacts:** [Many email systems allow different auto-reply messages for internal colleagues versus external contacts](https://support.microsoft.com/outlook-separate-internal-external-out-of-office). Use this feature to avoid sending vacation updates to candidates.

## The Comments Were Brutal (and Hilarious)

Reddit's recruiting community had strong reactions:

"Imagine being a candidate who gets 'Pura vida!' as a response to asking about interview next steps. I'd withdraw too." - u/RecruiterLife

"This is why I'm paranoid about email settings. I test EVERYTHING three times before activating it. One wrong checkbox can destroy weeks of recruiting work." - u/DetailOrientedRecruiter

"The fact that it took TWO WEEKS for anyone to notice is almost worse than the error itself. Nobody was monitoring candidate communications?" - u/QARecruiting

"I actually love that the recruiter was genuinely in Costa Rica as the auto-reply claimed. At least it was honest." - u/SilverLinings

[One comment summed it up: "This is a $10 email configuration mistake that probably cost them $100K+ in lost candidates, damaged employer brand, and recruiting team time to recover. Cheap lessons don't exist in recruiting."](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/out-of-office-candidate-disaster-2025/)

## The Final Word

[A single misconfigured email setting sent hundreds of job candidates vacation updates instead of interview coordination emails](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-communication-failures-impact-2025). [The result: withdrawn applications, missed interviews, damaged employer brand, and a recruiter who will never trust email auto-replies again](https://www.ere.net/recruiting-email-automation-mistakes-to-avoid/).

The lesson: recruiting automation makes life easier until it catastrophically doesn't. [Test your email settings, use shared candidate communication addresses, and have someone monitoring automated communications even when you're on vacation](https://www.greenhouse.io/candidate-communication-best-practices/).

And maybe, just maybe, skip the "Pura vida!" sign-off when your out-of-office might go to people waiting for job interview updates.

Though honestly, if you're going to accidentally send vacation messages to candidates, at least make it somewhere nice like Costa Rica.
