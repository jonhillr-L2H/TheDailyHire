[Remote work has made job interviewing during work hours embarrassingly easy](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/remote-work-job-searching-increase-2025). [Close your office door, take a video call, pretend you're "focused on a project," and conduct a full interview while technically on the clock at your current job](https://www.ere.net/remote-work-job-search-behavior-patterns-2025/).

[Most people are discreet about this](https://www.businessinsider.com/remote-workers-job-searching-during-work-2025). Neutral backgrounds. Plain walls. Maybe a tasteful bookshelf.

Not this candidate.

[This week, a senior developer interviewing for a new role conducted his video interview from his current employer's office—and everyone figured it out in the most awkward way possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zoom-interview-current-employer-office/).

## The Interview Was Going Great

Let's call our candidate "Mike." [Mike was interviewing for a senior backend engineer position at a fast-growing SaaS company](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-interview-fails-compilation-2025/).

The interview was going exceptionally well. Mike had solid experience, answered technical questions confidently, and had great energy. [The hiring manager was already mentally composing the offer letter](https://www.ere.net/hiring-manager-early-decision-making-interview-process-2025/).

Mike's video background looked fine—just a plain white wall behind him. [Nothing identifying. Totally professional](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-interview-backgrounds-professionalism-standards-2025).

Then, 35 minutes into the interview, **someone walked behind Mike**.

Not just walked behind him—**walked through the frame wearing a bright blue t-shirt with a very distinctive company logo**.

[The hiring manager recognized the logo immediately](https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-interview-background-reveals-current-employer-2025). It was the logo of Mike's current employer. A direct competitor.

Mike was conducting this interview **from his current employer's office**. During business hours. At 2pm on a Tuesday.

## The Awkward Realization

The hiring manager paused mid-sentence.

"Hey, uh... Mike? Is that... are you at [Company Name] right now?"

Mike's face did the thing faces do when someone realizes they've been caught doing something embarrassing. [That split-second of frozen panic before attempting to recover](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-psychological-life/micro-expressions-workplace-disasters).

"Oh, uh... no, I'm... working from home."

The hiring manager: "I just saw someone walk behind you wearing a [Company Name] shirt."

Mike: "That's... my roommate. He got it at a conference."

[Everyone on the call knew this was a lie](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/workplace-dishonesty-detection-interview-contexts-2025). The shirt wasn't a conference giveaway shirt. It was an employee shirt with the distinctive internal design that only actual employees wear.

Also, in the brief moment the coworker was visible, you could see **cubicles in the background**.

## The Truth Comes Out

The hiring manager, to his credit, didn't end the interview immediately. But the vibe had shifted.

"Mike, are you currently in your employer's office?"

[Silence. The kind of silence that screams "yes but I don't want to say yes"](https://www.ere.net/interview-communication-nonverbal-cues-analysis-2025/).

Finally: "Okay, yes. I work in a hybrid environment and I'm in the office today. I thought it would be fine to take the call from a conference room."

**Except he wasn't in a conference room.**

[The background clearly showed he was at his desk in an open office plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/interviewing-from-current-employer-office-disaster/). The coworker who walked by wasn't passing a closed conference room—he was walking through the normal office space.

Mike had positioned his laptop facing a wall to hide the office environment. It worked great until someone walked into frame.

## Why This Is Extra Awkward

[Job searching while employed is normal](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/employed-candidate-job-search-behavior-2025). [Interviewing during work hours is common, especially for remote workers](https://www.ere.net/remote-work-interview-scheduling-flexibility-2025). Nobody really judges that.

**But interviewing from your current employer's office while on the clock is a different level.**

Here's why this crossed a line:

**1. Using employer resources for job search**: [Conducting a personal job interview on company time, using company internet, from company property](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/employee-personal-business-work-time-policy-violations-2025). Most employment agreements explicitly prohibit this.

**2. Potential confidentiality issues**: [The hiring company is a direct competitor](https://www.businessinsider.com/competitor-employee-recruitment-confidentiality-concerns-2025). Mike's in their office, on a video call with their competitor, potentially with proprietary information visible around him. [That's a legal and ethical minefield](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/trade-secrets-employee-job-interviews-confidentiality-2025).

**3. The lying**: [Mike could have been honest—"I'm hybrid today and took this call from a quiet space in the office"](https://www.ere.net/interview-honesty-candidate-evaluation-factors-2025/). [Instead he tried to claim his coworker was his roommate who got a shirt at a conference](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/interview-lies-gone-wrong/). [The lie is worse than the original situation](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-dishonesty-interview-red-flags/719456/).

**4. The carelessness**: [If you're going to interview from your current employer's office, at minimum pick a spot where coworkers won't walk behind you on camera](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-interview-location-selection-best-practices-2025). [Mike chose a desk in an open office plan and hoped nobody would walk by](https://www.ere.net/video-interview-background-control-candidate-mistakes-2025/). [Poor judgment at best](https://www.hrdive.com/news/interview-preparation-candidate-professionalism-assessment/719678/).

## How The Interview Ended

[The hiring manager wrapped up the interview professionally but quickly](https://www.ere.net/interview-termination-red-flag-responses-2025/).

"Thanks for your time, Mike. We'll be in touch."

They were not, in fact, in touch.

[Mike sent a follow-up email the next day thanking them for the opportunity](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-follow-up-email-effectiveness-2025). [He didn't address the office situation](https://www.ere.net/interview-mistakes-candidate-recovery-strategies-2025/).

[The hiring manager sent a polite rejection two days later](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-rejection-communication-best-practices/719890/): "We've decided to move forward with other candidates whose experience more closely matches our needs."

[Translation: "We liked you until we realized you interview from your current employer's office and then lie about it"](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/rejection-email-real-meanings/).

## The Company's Perspective

Here's what the hiring manager told his team after the interview:

["The technical skills were there. But interviewing from a competitor's office during business hours shows terrible judgment. Then lying about it when caught shows character issues. If he's willing to do this to his current employer, he'd probably do it to us"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-behavior-current-employer-predictive-future-behavior-2025).

One team member asked: ["Should we tell his current employer?"](https://www.ere.net/ethical-dilemmas-candidate-misconduct-reporting-2025)

The hiring manager: ["No. That's not our business. We're just not hiring him."](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-behavior-reporting-employer-ethics-2025)

[Some companies might have reported this to Mike's employer, especially given the competitor relationship and potential confidentiality concerns](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/reporting-employee-misconduct-competitor-companies-2025). [This hiring manager took the high road—they just moved on](https://www.ere.net/candidate-rejection-no-feedback-approach-2025/).

## What Mike Should Have Done

[Job searching while employed is fine. Interviewing during work hours is fine](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/employed-candidate-interview-scheduling-2025). [Here's how to do it without career-destroying mistakes](https://www.ere.net/job-search-while-employed-best-practices-2025/):

**Take the call from home if possible**: [Use PTO, take a long lunch, schedule the interview before/after work](https://www.businessinsider.com/job-interview-scheduling-current-employment-discretion-2025). [Most companies offer early morning or late afternoon slots for exactly this reason](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-scheduling-employed-candidates-accommodation-2025).

**If you must take it during work, use a private space with a door**: [Conference room with the door closed. Car in a parking lot. Coffee shop. Not your desk in an open office](https://www.ere.net/video-interview-location-privacy-recommendations-2025/).

**Use a neutral virtual background if your location could be identifying**: [Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet all offer virtual backgrounds](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/video-conference-virtual-backgrounds-professional-use-2025). [Better than hoping nobody walks behind you wearing company swag](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-interview-background-control-techniques/720012/).

**Don't lie when caught**: ["I'm hybrid today and found a quiet space in the office for the call" is honest and reasonable](https://www.ere.net/interview-honesty-recovery-strategies-2025/). ["That's my roommate's conference shirt" is obviously false and makes everything worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/interview-lies-that-backfired/).

**Consider the optics with competitor companies**: [If you're interviewing with a direct competitor, be extra careful about confidentiality and potential conflicts of interest](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/employee-competitor-interviews-confidentiality-management-2025). [Don't give them any reason to question your judgment or ethics](https://www.ere.net/competitor-recruitment-candidate-evaluation-factors-2025/).

## The Lesson

[Remote work has blurred the lines between personal and professional time](https://www.hrdive.com/news/remote-work-personal-business-boundaries-2025). [Taking a phone call during lunch break at home? Fine. Conducting a video interview at your desk while your coworkers walk by? Not fine](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/remote-work-personal-business-appropriate-boundaries-2025).

[The issue isn't that Mike was job searching—it's that he showed poor judgment, got caught, and then lied about it](https://www.ere.net/candidate-judgment-assessment-interview-process-2025/).

[Hiring managers notice this stuff. And they factor it into their decisions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-behavior-hiring-decisions-factors-2025/).

[Mike probably didn't realize his coworker was about to walk by. But he should have picked a location where coworkers couldn't walk by in the first place](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-interview-preparation-location-selection-2025/).

**Also, a quick reminder to everyone:**

[If you're going to interview while working remotely, make sure nobody wearing your current employer's logo wanders into frame](https://www.ere.net/video-interview-background-control-best-practices-2025/).

[It's the kind of mistake you only make once](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/video-interview-fails-lessons-learned/). [Unfortunately for Mike, once was enough](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/interview-mistakes-career-impact-analysis-2025).
