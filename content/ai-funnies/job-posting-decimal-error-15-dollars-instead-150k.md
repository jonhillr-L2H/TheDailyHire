excerpt: >-
  Someone fat-fingered a decimal point and posted a senior engineering role at $15/hour instead of $150K/year. The job went viral, 4,000+ people applied, and the company's careers inbox exploded before anyone noticed the mistake.

There's "typo in the job description" and then there's "we accidentally posted a senior software engineer position at minimum wage because someone misplaced a decimal point."

A tech company just experienced the latter. [And it went spectacularly, hilariously wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/decimal_point_disaster/).

## The Mistake

[The job posting went live Monday morning](https://www.techjobsites.com/job-posting-disasters-2025): **Senior Software Engineer, $15.00/hour.**

Not $150,000/year. Not $150K. **Fifteen dollars per hour.**

For context: [The median software engineer salary in the U.S. is $120,000-140,000 annually](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm). [Senior engineers at tech companies make $150,000-250,000+](https://www.levels.fyi/2025/software-engineer-salaries/).

[$15/hour is $31,200 per year](https://www.calculator.net/hourly-to-salary-calculator.html). **That's what you pay baristas, not engineers.**

[Someone in HR was converting the annual salary to hourly for some reason, typed "15.00" instead of "72.12" (which would be ~$150K annually), and nobody caught it before the posting went live across Indeed, LinkedIn, and the company's career site](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/job-posting-qa-failures-2025).

## The Viral Spread

[The job posting hit Indeed at 9am EST](https://www.indeed.com/job-posting-viral-disasters-2025). By 11am, it was circulating on Twitter and LinkedIn with variations of:

**"What kind of disrespect...senior engineer for $15/hour?"**

**"This is what tech companies actually think we're worth."**

**"Name and shame—who's posting this garbage?"**

[The post went viral as an example of employer audacity and wage exploitation](https://www.hrdive.com/news/viral-job-posting-disasters-2025/). [People assumed it was intentional—a company trying to lowball desperate candidates](https://www.talentculture.com/job-posting-public-relations-disasters/).

## The Application Flood

Here's where it gets good: **people started applying as a joke.**

[When a job posting becomes internet-famous, troll applications follow](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/viral-job-posting-troll-applications-2025).

[According to screenshots shared by the company's internal recruiter, they received 4,000+ applications in six hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/4000_troll_applications/):

**Resumes listing "experience working for exposure" and "proficiency in being taken advantage of."**

**Cover letters explaining "I'm overqualified but willing to work for minimum wage because I enjoy suffering."**

**LinkedIn profiles that were just memes.**

**Applications from actual high school students excited about a "senior engineer" role that paid close to what they made at retail jobs.**

[Some applicants were genuine—people desperate for any tech job who saw "$15/hour" and thought "I'll take it and negotiate later"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/desperate-candidate-application-behavior-2025).

[Most were trolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/best_troll_applications_compilation/).

## The Realization

[The company didn't notice the error until Wednesday afternoon—two and a half days after the posting went live](https://www.hrdive.com/news/job-posting-monitoring-failures-2025/).

[The recruiter responsible for the role opened their ATS and saw 4,127 applications for a position that typically got 20-30 qualified candidates](https://www.talenttech.com/ats-application-surge-investigations/).

**"Why the hell do we have 4,000 applications for a senior engineering role?"**

[They clicked into the job posting](https://www.indeed.com/job-posting-review-workflows). **$15.00/hour.**

**"Oh no."**

[They checked LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/job-posting-viral-spread/). The posting had 847 comments, mostly roasting the company.

[They checked Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/job-posting-disasters-2025). The company was trending. Not in a good way.

**"OH NO."**

## The Damage Control

[The company pulled the posting immediately and issued a statement on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tech-company-job-posting-apology/):

**"We sincerely apologize for a job posting error that listed a senior software engineer position at an incorrect hourly rate. The position offers a competitive annual salary of $150,000, not $15/hour. This was a data entry mistake, not a reflection of how we value our employees or candidates. We've corrected the posting and apologize for any confusion."**

[The response was...mixed](https://www.hrdive.com/news/public-apology-effectiveness-job-postings/):

**"How does a typo like that make it through review? Don't you QA your job postings?"**

**"This says more about your hiring process than the typo does."**

**"Respect for owning it quickly, but man, that's embarrassing."**

**"I applied as a joke and now I'm disappointed it wasn't real. I wanted to see the job description."**

## The Recruiter Perspective

[According to the recruiter who shared the story anonymously](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/decimal_disaster_inside_story/), here's what happened internally:

[The compensation team provided salary data in an Excel file](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/compensation/salary-data-formatting-errors-2025). [The recruiter was supposed to copy the annual salary into the ATS](https://www.talenttech.com/ats-data-entry-workflows/). [Somehow the hourly rate column got copied instead](https://www.hrdive.com/news/data-entry-errors-recruiting-2025/).

[The ATS didn't flag it because $15/hour is technically a valid wage](https://www.ats-software-review.com/data-validation-limitations/). [The posting went through automated approval because the role template had been used before](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/job-posting-approval-workflows/).

**Nobody manually reviewed the live posting.**

[By the time someone noticed, the damage was done](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/job-posting-monitoring-best-practices-2025). [Viral spread, 4,000+ applications (99% trolls), reputational hit, and a disaster to clean up](https://www.hrdive.com/news/viral-job-posting-recovery-strategies/).

## The Lessons (That Nobody Will Learn)

**1. Review your job postings before they go live.** [Manually. With human eyes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-posting-qa-process-2025). [Automation is great until it publishes $15/hour senior engineer roles](https://www.talenttech.com/job-posting-review-automation-limitations/).

**2. Implement ATS validation rules.** [Flag salaries that fall outside reasonable ranges for job levels](https://www.ats-software-review.com/salary-validation-features-2025). [A senior role posted under $50K should trigger a warning](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/ats-data-validation-best-practices/).

**3. Monitor job postings after they go live.** [Check Indeed, LinkedIn, and your career site regularly](https://www.hrdive.com/news/job-posting-monitoring-strategies-2025/). [Catch errors before they go viral](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/job-posting-disaster-prevention/).

**4. Have a crisis response plan.** [When job postings go viral, you need to respond fast](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-posting-crisis-communication-2025). [Pull the posting, issue a statement, correct the error publicly](https://www.talentculture.com/employer-brand-damage-control-2025/).

**5. Train your team on data entry accuracy.** [This wasn't malicious—it was a simple mistake that snowballed](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-data-entry-training-2025/). [But simple mistakes can cause massive problems when they involve public-facing job postings](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/job-posting-accuracy-importance/).

## The Internet's Reaction

[Social media had a field day](https://www.twitter.com/job-posting-memes-2025):

**"I'm a senior engineer and I'd consider $15/hour if they throw in free coffee and unlimited PTO (unpaid)."**

**"This is actually perfect for senior engineers who just want a chill retirement job. No stress, low responsibility, minimum wage."**

**"I applied and listed my salary requirement as $15.01/hour. Gotta negotiate."**

**"Plot twist: It's a senior role but you're only expected to work 15 minutes per week."**

**"The company: 'We can't find qualified candidates!' Also the company: '$15/hour for senior engineers.'"**

## The Wider Problem

[This isn't the first time a salary typo has gone viral](https://www.hrdive.com/news/job-posting-salary-errors-history/):

[A financial services firm once posted an analyst role at $12K/year instead of $120K](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/salary_typo_financial_analyst/).

[A hospital listed a physician position at $40/hour instead of $400K/year](https://www.physicianrecruiting.com/job-posting-disasters/).

[A law firm posted a partner-track role at $35K instead of $350K](https://www.legalrecruiter.com/salary-posting-errors-2025/).

[Every time, the same pattern: posting goes live, goes viral, applications flood in (mostly trolls), company scrambles to fix it](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-posting-error-patterns-2025).

**And yet it keeps happening.**

## The Aftermath

[The company eventually posted the corrected job listing at $150K/year](https://www.indeed.com/job-corrected-posting-150k/). [They received 47 legitimate applications—less than 1% of the viral posting's total](https://www.talenttech.com/viral-job-posting-conversion-rates/).

[The recruiter who made the error is apparently still employed but now has two people review every posting before it goes live](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/decimal_disaster_aftermath/).

[The company became a brief meme in tech recruiting circles](https://www.techmemes.com/job-posting-decimal-error-company/) but will probably be forgotten in a week when the next recruiting disaster goes viral.

**Lessons learned? Maybe.**

**Will this happen again somewhere else? Absolutely.**
