# Candidate's AI Thank-You Note Goes to Wrong Company, Gets Offers from Both

AUSTIN, TX - In what experts are calling "the most successful failure in recruiting history," job candidate Tom Patterson somehow received offers from two different companies after his AI-generated thank-you email referenced the wrong organization entirely.

Patterson, who interviewed with software company DataSync Solutions on Tuesday, used an AI tool to generate a professional thank-you email afterward. Unfortunately, the AI apparently pulled information from Patterson's previous interview notes and crafted a thoughtful message thanking DataSync for "the opportunity to learn about CloudTech Innovations' impressive customer success metrics."

CloudTech Innovations is DataSync's direct competitor and the company Patterson had interviewed with the previous week.

"I sent it at 11 PM after a long day and didn't proofread because the AI preview looked professional," Patterson admitted. "I woke up to a very confused email from DataSync's hiring manager asking if I'd meant to apply there or at CloudTech."

But here's where it gets weird: DataSync's hiring manager, impressed by Patterson's "bold transparency about interviewing with competitors" and "refreshing honesty about his process," decided the mix-up demonstrated authenticity in a sea of generic thank-you emails.

"Most candidates send us obviously templated thank-you notes," explained DataSync hiring manager Rebecca Torres. "Getting one that was clearly meant for our competitor was so bizarre that it felt more genuine than the usual 'I'm passionate about your mission' emails we normally receive."

DataSync extended an offer two days later.

Meanwhile, Patterson's thank-you email to DataSync had been automatically forwarded to CloudTech's hiring manager by a mutual contact who found the mix-up hilarious. CloudTech, reading about how much Patterson "enjoyed learning about DataSync's innovative approach to data synchronization," was impressed by what they interpreted as strategic research into competitors.

"We thought he was doing sophisticated competitive analysis," said CloudTech's recruiter Mark Stevens. "The fact that he'd clearly studied our competitor's value proposition in detail suggested serious preparation and strategic thinking."

CloudTech extended their own offer three days later.

Patterson now finds himself in the enviable position of choosing between two companies, both of which hired him partially because he accidentally confused them with each other.

"I've learned that the key to recruiting success is failing so spectacularly that it loops back around to impressive," Patterson reflected. "Also, I've stopped using AI for thank-you emails."

The incident has sparked debate in recruiting circles about whether AI-generated communications are making the hiring process better or just creating new categories of disasters.

"This is what happens when candidates use AI and don't proofread, and when companies are so starved for authentic communication that an obvious error feels refreshing," noted recruiting consultant Lisa Chen. "We've created a system where mistakes are more memorable than perfection."

Patterson ultimately accepted DataSync's offer, citing their "good humor about the whole situation" and "willingness to hire people who send emails to the wrong company." He reportedly sent both organizations handwritten thank-you notes, which he checked three times before mailing.

CloudTech's hiring manager was philosophical about losing the candidate: "Honestly, the fact that he chose our competitor after accidentally praising us to them feels very on-brand for this entire situation."

Both companies have updated their recruiting processes to include a new interview question: "Did you use AI to generate your application materials, and if so, did you at least read them first?"

Patterson's AI tool has been banned from his computer, though he admits it "has a better offer acceptance rate than most recruiters."
