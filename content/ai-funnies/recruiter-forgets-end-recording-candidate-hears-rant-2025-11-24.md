This actually happened. A recruiter conducting video interviews thought they clicked "End Recording" after wrapping up with a candidate. They did not. What they actually clicked was "Minimize" while the recording continued capturing the next fifteen minutes of their unfiltered thoughts about the interview they'd just conducted.

[The video interview platform then helpfully auto-sent the complete recording to the candidate, as configured, "within 24 hours of interview completion."](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/recruiter-rant-recording-sent-2025/)

The candidate received a video file titled "Interview_Recording_Final.mp4"—44 minutes long. Their interview was 29 minutes. The bonus content was unforgettable.

## The Rant Heard Round the Internet

[According to the candidate's now-viral post](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/recruiter-rant-recording-sent-2025/), the first 29 minutes were standard interview footage. Professional questions, thoughtful answers, smiles and nods. Normal stuff.

Then the recruiter said, "Thanks so much for your time today! We'll be in touch soon." The candidate's video feed ended as they left the call.

The recruiter's feed did not.

"I watched her lean back in her chair, take off her headset, and just... go off," the candidate wrote. "She looked at my resume, which was still on her screen, and said out loud: 'Who uses Papyrus font on a resume in 2025? Is this person trying to get rejected?'"

The rant continued. Highlights included:

- "Entry-level role asking for $95,000. In this economy. The audacity."
- "Seven years of experience and no management experience? What have they been doing?"
- "I cannot believe they asked about remote work flexibility. Did they read the job posting? It says hybrid. HYBRID."
- A four-minute digression about how candidates "don't respect the process anymore"
- "I'm putting this one in the 'maybe' pile. And by 'maybe' I mean 'absolutely not but I'm too tired to reject them right now.'"

[The recruiter then took a phone call from what appeared to be another candidate, during which she said: "Oh yes, we're very excited about your application! You're definitely one of our top candidates."](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/recruiter-rant-recording-sent-2025/)

The contrast was, as the candidate noted, "genuinely illuminating."

## The Aftermath

[The candidate did not quietly receive their rejection email and move on](https://twitter.com/RecruitingFails/status/rant-recording-response-2025/). Instead, they posted excerpts of the recording (with their own identifying information removed) to multiple platforms, where it went viral with over 200,000 views across Reddit and Twitter.

The recruiter was placed on administrative leave pending an internal review. [The company issued a statement: "We are aware of a video that has circulated online and are taking the matter very seriously. The views expressed do not represent our values as an organization."](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/company-statement-recruiter-rant-2025/)

Recruiters in the comments section were split. Some sympathized: "We've all vented after interviews. She just got caught." Others were less forgiving: "This is why we need to treat every moment like we're being recorded. Because sometimes, apparently, we are."

## The Lesson Buried in the Chaos

Here's the thing: everyone vents. Recruiters deal with hundreds of candidates, unrealistic expectations, and endless pressure. Thinking uncharitable thoughts about a resume's font choice is human. Saying them out loud is human too.

Saying them out loud on a recording that gets auto-sent to the candidate? That's a process failure.

[The platform has since added a confirmation dialog before ending recordings and a 60-second delay before auto-sending to allow for review](https://www.zoom.us/blog/recording-settings-update-recruiter-feedback/). Cold comfort for everyone involved.

The broader wisdom: assume every video call is being recorded. Assume every Slack message will be screenshot. Assume every email will be forwarded. Because in the digital age, privacy is an illusion and "End Recording" buttons are apparently suggestions.

[The candidate, for what it's worth, received three job offers from other companies after their post went viral](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/recruiter-rant-viral-job-offers-2025/). Apparently, being publicly mocked for your font choice builds sympathy.

The recruiter reportedly updated their LinkedIn to "Open to Work" two weeks later. The circle of recruiting life continues.
