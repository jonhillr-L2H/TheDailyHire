American manufacturing is experiencing something it hasn't seen in decades: genuine growth. [Companies are building new factories, expanding existing facilities, and bringing production back from overseas](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/reshoring-boom-2025).

There's just one problem: **nobody knows how to do these jobs.**

[Manufacturing and supply chain companies are hiring for 780,000+ open positions right now](https://www.nam.org/workforce-shortage-2025/), and that number is projected to hit 2.1 million unfilled roles by 2030. [Recruiters are getting bombarded with reqs for CNC machinists, welders, quality engineers, and supply chain managers—roles that basically disappeared from the U.S. labor market for 20 years](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/manufacturing-recruiting-challenges-2025).

Welcome to the reshoring recruiting crisis.

## The Reshoring Wave Is Real

This isn't theoretical anymore. [Major manufacturers are announcing multi-billion dollar U.S. facility investments](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/reshoring-investments-2025/):

[Intel is building semiconductor fabs in Ohio and Arizona—$100 billion investment, 10,000+ jobs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/ohio-arizona-expansion.html). [TSMC is constructing chip plants in Arizona—$40 billion, 4,500+ jobs](https://www.tsmc.com/english/news/arizona-expansion). [Micron is building memory chip facilities in New York—$100 billion, 9,000+ jobs](https://www.micron.com/about/blog/micron-new-york-investment).

[Battery manufacturers for electric vehicles are building plants across the Midwest and South](https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/ev-battery-plant-construction-2025). [General Motors, Ford, Toyota, and Hyundai are all expanding U.S. manufacturing capacity](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/us-auto-manufacturing-expansion).

[Pharmaceutical companies are reshoring drug and medical device production](https://www.pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/supply-chain-logistics/reshoring-pharmaceutical-manufacturing-2025/). [Consumer goods manufacturers are bringing production back from China](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/consumer-goods-reshoring-trend-2025/).

[The Reshoring Initiative reports 2025 is seeing the highest level of announced manufacturing jobs returning to the U.S. since they started tracking data](https://reshorenow.org/blog/reshoring-data-2025/).

## The Skills Gap Is Catastrophic

Here's the brutal reality: [The U.S. hasn't trained enough manufacturing workers in 30 years](https://www.nationalskillscoalition.org/news/press-releases/manufacturing-skills-shortage-2025/).

[The average age of a skilled manufacturing worker in the U.S. is 56](https://www.nam.org/aging-workforce-manufacturing/). [Retirements are accelerating and there's nobody trained to replace them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-hr-strategy/manufacturing-retirement-wave-2025).

**The roles companies need don't exist in the current workforce:**

[CNC machinists who can program and operate 5-axis machines](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/cnc-machinist-shortage). [Industrial maintenance technicians who can troubleshoot robotics and automation systems](https://www.plantservices.com/labor/article/maintenance-technician-shortage-2025). [Quality engineers who understand statistical process control and Six Sigma](https://www.qualitymag.com/articles/quality-engineer-shortage).

[Supply chain managers who can design resilient domestic networks after decades of optimizing for offshore production](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/supply-chain-talent-reshoring-2025/). [Manufacturing engineers who can bring production lines online in greenfield facilities](https://www.sme.org/manufacturing-engineer-shortage-2025/).

[Welders certified for high-precision work on aerospace and semiconductor equipment](https://aws.org/welder-shortage-2025). [Electricians who can wire and maintain advanced manufacturing facilities](https://www.neca.org/electrician-shortage-manufacturing/).

## The Community College Problem

Everyone points to community colleges and vocational programs as the solution. [The problem: these programs were systematically defunded and eliminated over the past 30 years](https://www.communitycollegereview.com/blog/vocational-program-decline).

[The U.S. lost 50% of its vocational and technical education programs between 1990 and 2020](https://www.ed.gov/stem/vocational-education-decline). [High schools eliminated shop classes, metalworking programs, and technical training](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/shop-class-decline-2025).

[Community colleges that still have manufacturing programs face waitlists of 12-18 months](https://www.aacc.nche.edu/programs/workforce-development/manufacturing-program-waitlists/). [They're constrained by facility capacity, equipment costs, and instructor shortages](https://www.communitycollegereview.com/blog/manufacturing-instructor-shortage-2025).

[Companies need workers now—they can't wait two years for someone to complete a training program](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/manufacturing-training-timeline-problem).

## What Companies Are Actually Doing

Manufacturers are getting creative (read: desperate):

**Building their own training programs**: [Intel is creating its own semiconductor technician training academy](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/semiconductor-training-program.html). [GM and Ford are partnering with community colleges to create custom curriculums](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/oem-training-partnerships-2025).

**Paying for certifications and degrees**: [Companies are offering full tuition reimbursement for manufacturing-related degrees and certifications](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/manufacturing-tuition-benefits-2025). [Some are paying employees to attend training during work hours](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/paid-training-time-manufacturing).

**Recruiting from the military**: [Military veterans with technical training are being heavily recruited](https://www.hiringourheroes.org/manufacturing-veteran-recruiting-2025/). [Transitioning service members with electronics, mechanical, or logistics experience are prime targets](https://www.defense.gov/News/military-to-manufacturing-pipeline/).

**Raiding competitors**: [Poaching is rampant—companies are offering 25-40% raises to steal talent from competitors](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/manufacturing-talent-poaching-2025/). [Signing bonuses of $10K-25K for experienced machinists and technicians are common](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/manufacturing-signing-bonuses-2025).

**International recruiting**: [Companies are sponsoring H-1B and other work visas to bring in foreign manufacturing talent](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/manufacturing-visa-sponsorship-2025). [Some are recruiting entire teams from Mexico, Canada, and Europe](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/international-manufacturing-recruiting/).

**Apprenticeship programs**: [Germany-style apprenticeship models are being implemented—pay people to learn while working](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/manufacturing-apprenticeships-2025). [Programs typically run 2-4 years with progressive wage increases](https://www.nam.org/apprenticeship-programs-manufacturing/).

## The Geographic Challenge

Reshoring isn't happening in places with existing manufacturing talent pools. [New factories are being built in locations chosen for tax incentives and proximity to materials—not labor availability](https://www.site-selection.com/manufacturing-location-decisions-2025/).

[Intel's Ohio facility is in a region without a deep semiconductor workforce](https://www.dispatch.com/story/business/intel-workforce-challenges-ohio/). [Battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee are in automotive regions but need entirely different skill sets](https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/battery-plant-workforce-challenges).

[These companies need to attract workers to relocate to places like Licking County, Ohio and Upstate New York—not exactly hotbeds of young talent](https://www.relocationstrategies.com/manufacturing-relocation-recruitment/).

## The Wage War

[Manufacturing wages are increasing faster than almost any other sector](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/manufacturing-wage-growth-2025.htm):

[Average manufacturing hourly wage hit $32.50, up 12% year-over-year](https://www.nam.org/manufacturing-compensation-2025/). [Skilled positions like CNC machinists and quality engineers are commanding $60K-90K in low-cost-of-living areas](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Manufacturing/Salary).

[In high-demand specialties, wages are getting ridiculous](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/manufacturing-wage-premiums-2025): [Experienced semiconductor technicians: $80K-120K](https://www.indeed.com/career/semiconductor-technician/salaries). [Industrial electricians with automation experience: $70K-100K](https://www.salary.com/research/industrial-electrician-automation). [Supply chain managers with reshoring experience: $95K-140K](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/supply-chain-manager-compensation-2025/).

**And it's still hard to fill roles.**

## What Recruiters Are Learning

If you're recruiting for manufacturing clients, here's the reality:

**The talent doesn't exist on LinkedIn**: [Most skilled manufacturing workers aren't on social media](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/manufacturing-recruiting-channels-2025). [They're not updating resumes or browsing job boards](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/manufacturing-passive-candidates/).

**You need to recruit from competitors**: [Everyone is hiring from everyone else](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/manufacturing-recruiting-competition/). [The only source of experienced talent is currently employed people](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/passive-candidate-manufacturing/).

**Trade schools and community colleges are goldmines**: [Build relationships with program directors](https://www.aacc.nche.edu/programs/workforce-development/employer-partnerships/). [Sponsor students, offer internships, speak at career days](https://www.communitycollegereview.com/blog/employer-engagement-strategies-2025).

**Military recruiting is essential**: [Partner with Hiring Our Heroes, VET TEC, and SkillBridge programs](https://www.hiringourheroes.org/employer-resources/). [Veterans with technical MOSs are perfect fits](https://www.defense.gov/News/military-occupational-specialties-manufacturing/).

**Relocation packages are mandatory**: [If your facility isn't in a major metro, you need to pay people to move](https://www.relocationstrategies.com/manufacturing-relocation-packages-2025/). [Generous packages—$15K-30K plus home buying assistance](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/relocation-benefits-manufacturing/).

**Internal training is the only scalable solution**: [You can't hire your way out of this](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/manufacturing-training-strategy/). [Companies need to hire for aptitude and train for skill](https://www.nam.org/hire-for-aptitude-train-for-skill/).

## The Automation Paradox

Here's the irony: [Companies are investing in automation to reduce labor needs, which requires even more skilled technicians to maintain and operate automated systems](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/automation-workforce-paradox-2025/).

[A traditional assembly line might need 50 line workers but 2 technicians](https://www.sme.org/traditional-manufacturing-workforce/). [An automated line needs 15 line workers but 8 technicians](https://www.sme.org/automated-manufacturing-workforce/). **The skills required are higher, not lower.**

[Companies that thought automation would solve their labor problems are discovering they just shifted the problem to finding highly skilled technicians instead of semi-skilled operators](https://www.industryweek.com/talent/article/automation-creates-skilled-labor-shortage).

## The Bottom Line

[Reshoring is happening whether we're ready or not](https://reshorenow.org/blog/reshoring-trend-2025/). [Government incentives, supply chain resilience concerns, and geopolitical tensions are driving production back to the U.S.](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/reshoring-drivers-2025/)

[The workforce to support this doesn't exist, and won't exist for years](https://www.nationalskillscoalition.org/news/press-releases/manufacturing-workforce-development-needs/).

For manufacturing recruiters: **you're going to be busy, frustrated, and highly valuable.** Learn the trade, build relationships with training programs, get comfortable recruiting passive candidates, and prepare to explain to executives why their ambitious hiring plans are mathematically impossible.
