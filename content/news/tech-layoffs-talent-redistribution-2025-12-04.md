Remember when Big Tech was the final destination for every ambitious engineer? Well, 2025 had other plans. After multiple rounds of layoffs at major tech companies, the talent redistribution map looks nothing like anyone predicted. Turns out, former FAANG employees are popping up in the most unexpected places.

## Startups Are Having Their Moment

While the giants were trimming headcount, scrappy startups were basically running a Black Friday sale on senior talent. [Crunchbase News](https://news.crunchbase.com) reports that seed and Series A companies hired 43% more ex-Big Tech employees in 2025 compared to 2024. Why? Because suddenly they could afford them.

A senior engineer who would've cost a startup $300K+ in total comp two years ago is now willing to take $180K and equity for the chance to actually ship something without seventeen layers of approval. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com) interviewed dozens of laid-off workers who said they're "done with corporate politics" and want to build again. Recruiters at early-stage companies are calling it the talent opportunity of a decade.

But here's the catch: not everyone is cut out for startup chaos. About 30% of these hires churned within six months, according to [LinkedIn's Workforce Report](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com). Turns out, there's a big difference between saying you want to work at a startup and actually thriving when there's no free lunch, limited PTO, and your health insurance is "pretty okay."

## Government and Non-Tech Industries Are Getting Smart

The real surprise? Government agencies and traditional industries are scooping up tech talent like never before. [FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com) reports that federal tech hiring increased 28% in 2025, with many new hires coming from private sector layoffs. The U.S. Digital Service and 18F are suddenly competitive because—and I can't believe I'm saying this—their job security looks pretty good right now.

Meanwhile, industries that historically struggled to attract tech workers are having a renaissance. Healthcare tech, logistics, manufacturing automation, and even agriculture technology are absorbing laid-off talent. [Built In](https://builtin.com) found that 22% of displaced tech workers moved to industries they'd never considered before 2025.

## The Recession-Proof Pivot

Some laid-off tech workers looked at the market and said "absolutely not" to all of it. [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com), the anonymous professional network, shows a surge in tech workers moving into consulting, freelancing, or starting their own businesses. The gig economy got a massive injection of overqualified talent.

Recruiters trying to fill enterprise roles are competing with the freedom of contract work. Why take a full-time job that might disappear in the next layoff cycle when you can charge $200/hour as a consultant and control your own destiny? It's a fair question, and it's making traditional tech recruitment harder than ever.

## What This Means for Recruiters

If you're recruiting in tech right now, the playbook has changed. Top talent isn't just evaluating your offer—they're evaluating whether traditional employment even makes sense anymore. Job security matters again. Culture isn't a nice-to-have; it's a dealbreaker. And candidates are asking harder questions about runway, profitability, and layoff history.

The talent is out there. It's just redistributed, recalibrated, and way more skeptical than it used to be. Welcome to recruiting in the post-layoff era—where everyone's available, but nobody's easy to close.
