For years, California's salary history ban was technically law but rarely enforced. [Companies asked about previous salary during interviews, and nothing happened](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/california-salary-history-ban-enforcement-2025).

That changed in October 2025. [California's Labor Commissioner announced aggressive enforcement of the salary history ban, and companies are getting hit with fines](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/salary-history-ban-enforcement-2025.html).

[The first batch of enforcement actions included fines ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per violation](https://www.laborcommissioner.ca.gov/enforcement/salary-history-violations-2025/). And the violations? Simple questions like "What's your current salary?" during phone screens.

If your company hires in California, you need to understand what changed and how to avoid fines.

## What California's Salary History Ban Actually Says

[California Labor Code Section 432.3 prohibits employers from asking about salary history](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=432.3.&lawCode=LAB).

**Specifically, employers cannot:**

- Ask a job applicant about their salary history (including compensation and benefits)
- Ask about salary history before extending an offer
- Rely on salary history as a factor in deciding whether to offer employment or what salary to offer

**What employers CAN do:**

- Ask about salary expectations
- Discuss the salary range for the position being offered
- Consider salary history information if a candidate voluntarily discloses it (without prompting)

[The law has been on the books since January 1, 2018](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/california-pay-equity.html). So why is enforcement happening now, seven years later?

## Why Enforcement Suddenly Got Real In October 2025

[California's Labor Commissioner's Office announced a "Wage Equity Enforcement Initiative" in October 2025](https://www.laborcommissioner.ca.gov/wage-equity-initiative-2025/), focusing on salary history violations and pay transparency compliance.

**What triggered this:**

[A coalition of worker advocacy groups filed complaints documenting widespread violations](https://www.workersrights.org/california-salary-history-violations-report/). They conducted "audit tests" where volunteers applied for jobs and recorded recruiters asking prohibited questions.

[The report documented violations at 47 companies, including major tech firms, healthcare organizations, and retailers](https://www.latimes.com/business/california-salary-history-enforcement-2025).

[California's Labor Commissioner used this report to launch investigations](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/salary-history-investigation-2025.html), resulting in the first wave of fines issued in late October 2025.

**The enforcement strategy:**

[The Labor Commissioner is prioritizing "systemic violations"](https://www.laborcommissioner.ca.gov/enforcement-priorities-2025/)—companies whose recruiters or HR staff routinely ask about salary history, not isolated incidents.

[Companies with documented patterns of asking salary history questions are facing fines of $10,000-$100,000 per case, plus requirements to implement training and compliance monitoring](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/california-salary-history-fines-2025).

## Which Companies Got Fined (And Why)

[The Labor Commissioner hasn't publicly named all companies fined, but several have been confirmed through legal filings](https://www.courthousenews.com/california-salary-history-enforcement-cases-2025/):

**Tech startup (San Francisco):** $45,000 fine. [Recruiter asked candidates "What's your current compensation?" during initial phone screens](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/california-startup-salary-history-fine/).

**Healthcare system (Los Angeles):** $100,000 fine. [HR department required candidates to fill out forms listing previous salaries as part of the application process](https://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare-salary-history-violation-fine/).

**Retail chain (statewide):** $75,000 fine. [Hiring managers asked about previous hourly wages during interviews](https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/retail-salary-history-fine/).

**Financial services company (San Diego):** $60,000 fine. [Background check authorization forms included a field for "previous salary"](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/financial-services-salary-history-fine/).

**The common thread:** [These weren't isolated mistakes—the Labor Commissioner found evidence of repeated violations across multiple candidates and time periods](https://www.laborcommissioner.ca.gov/enforcement-criteria-2025/).

## What Questions Are Prohibited (And What's Allowed)

The line between legal and illegal salary questions can be subtle.

**ILLEGAL (will get you fined):**

- "What's your current salary?"
- "What did you make at your last job?"
- "What's your salary history?"
- "What are you currently earning?"
- Including salary history fields on application forms
- Asking for W-2s or pay stubs before making an offer
- Contacting previous employers to verify salary information

**LEGAL (you can ask these):**

- "What are your salary expectations for this role?"
- "What salary range are you targeting?"
- "The range for this position is $X-$Y—does that align with your expectations?"
- Disclosing the salary range for the position (and you must do this if asked)

**GRAY AREA (proceed carefully):**

[If a candidate voluntarily discloses their current or previous salary without prompting, you can consider it](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/california-salary-history-voluntary-disclosure). But you cannot ask follow-up questions about salary history.

**Example:**

**Candidate:** "I'm currently making $120K, and I'm looking for a step up to $140K-$150K."

**Legal response:** "Thanks for sharing that. The range for this position is $135K-$165K depending on experience."

**Illegal response:** "What's the breakdown of your $120K? Base salary, bonus, equity?"

[The safest approach: Don't ask about salary history at all, even if the candidate brings it up first](https://www.californiaemploymentlaw.com/salary-history-ban-compliance/).

## Pay Transparency Requirements Added To Enforcement Focus

[California's enforcement initiative also covers SB 1162, the pay transparency law that went into effect January 1, 2023](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/california-pay-transparency-law.html).

**What SB 1162 requires:**

[Employers with 15+ employees must include salary ranges in all job postings](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1162).

[The Labor Commissioner is now fining companies for violations](https://www.laborcommissioner.ca.gov/pay-transparency-enforcement-2025/):

- Job postings without salary ranges: $100-$10,000 per violation
- Refusing to provide salary range when asked by applicant: $100-$10,000 per violation

**Recent enforcement examples:**

[A Los Angeles tech company was fined $50,000 for posting 127 jobs without salary ranges](https://www.latimes.com/business/tech-company-pay-transparency-fine-2025/).

[A San Francisco financial services firm was fined $35,000 for refusing to provide salary ranges when candidates asked](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/financial-services-pay-transparency-violation/).

[The combination of salary history ban enforcement and pay transparency enforcement means California employers face significant compliance risk](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/california-wage-equity-enforcement-risk).

## How Companies Are Responding

[Most California employers are scrambling to update their recruiting practices](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/california-employers-salary-compliance-updates).

**Common changes:**

**Recruiter training:** [Companies are retraining recruiters and hiring managers on prohibited questions](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/recruiting-tips/california-salary-history-compliance-training). Scripts and phone screen guides are being updated to remove salary history questions.

**Application form updates:** [Any forms requesting previous salary information are being removed](https://www.workable.com/blog/california-salary-history-ban-compliance).

**ATS configuration changes:** [Applicant tracking systems are being configured to block salary history fields](https://www.greenhouse.com/blog/california-pay-equity-compliance).

**Interview process audits:** [HR teams are conducting audits of recent interviews to identify patterns of non-compliance](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/salary-history-compliance-audit-process).

**Salary range standardization:** [Companies are developing clear salary ranges for all positions to comply with pay transparency requirements](https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/california-pay-transparency-compliance/).

## What About Remote Positions?

[If a position can be performed remotely in California, you must comply with California law—even if your company is based elsewhere](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/california-pay-laws-remote-workers-2025).

**This means:**

- Don't ask about salary history for any candidate who could work remotely in California
- Include salary ranges in job postings for remote-eligible positions
- Apply California rules even if your headquarters is in another state

[Several recent enforcement cases involved out-of-state companies hiring remote California workers](https://www.californiaemploymentlaw.com/remote-worker-salary-history-violations/).

## Other States With Similar Laws

[California isn't alone—salary history bans exist in 21 states and multiple cities](https://www.hrdive.com/news/salary-history-ban-states-2025/):

**States with salary history bans:**
- California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington

**Cities/counties with bans:**
- New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Louisville, New Orleans, Salt Lake City, Albany County (NY)

[However, California's enforcement is the most aggressive](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/california-leads-salary-history-enforcement). Most other jurisdictions have salary history bans but minimal enforcement.

[Expect other states to follow California's lead](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/salary-history-ban-enforcement-trend-2025). If California demonstrates that enforcement generates revenue and creates compliance, other states will likely increase enforcement efforts.

## How To Audit Your Company's Compliance

[If you hire in California, conduct a compliance audit immediately](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/salary-history-compliance-audit-checklist):

**1. Review job postings:**
- Do all California-eligible postings include salary ranges?
- Are ranges realistic and accurate?

**2. Audit application forms:**
- Do any forms ask for salary history?
- Do background check forms request previous compensation?

**3. Review interview scripts:**
- Do phone screen scripts include prohibited questions?
- Are hiring managers trained on legal vs. illegal salary questions?

**4. Check ATS configuration:**
- Does your ATS include salary history fields?
- Can candidates be required to enter previous salary information?

**5. Review recent interviews:**
- Have recruiters or hiring managers asked about salary history?
- Are there documented instances of violations?

**6. Train your team:**
- Ensure everyone involved in hiring knows what questions are prohibited
- Provide scripts with legal alternatives
- Explain consequences of violations

[Companies that proactively audit and fix compliance issues are less likely to face enforcement actions](https://www.laborcommissioner.ca.gov/voluntary-compliance-2025/).

## The Bottom Line

[California's salary history ban enforcement marks a significant shift from "law on the books" to "law with teeth"](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/california-salary-history-enforcement-analysis-2025).

**For employers hiring in California:**

- Stop asking about salary history—immediately
- Include salary ranges in all job postings
- Train recruiters and hiring managers on compliance
- Audit your recruiting process for violations
- Expect enforcement to continue and potentially expand

[The Labor Commissioner has signaled this is a priority](https://www.laborcommissioner.ca.gov/enforcement-priorities-2025/). Fines will continue. Companies that ignore compliance risk significant financial penalties.

[Other states are watching California's enforcement](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/state-salary-history-ban-enforcement-trends). Expect similar actions in New York, Colorado, Washington, and other states with salary history bans.

**The recruiting playbook has changed.** Companies that adapt to pay equity laws will have an advantage. Those that don't will face fines, legal exposure, and damaged employer brands.
