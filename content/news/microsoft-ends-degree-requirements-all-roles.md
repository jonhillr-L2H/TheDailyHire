On October 30, 2025, Microsoft made a quiet but significant announcement: [the company is removing degree requirements from all job postings globally](https://www.microsoft.com/careers/skills-first-hiring-2025).

Not just entry-level roles. Not just certain departments. **All roles.** Including software engineering, product management, and senior leadership positions.

[Microsoft joins Google, Apple, IBM, and Accenture in eliminating degree requirements](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/tech-companies-drop-degree-requirements-2025), but Microsoft's move is the most comprehensive yet—covering every single role in the company.

The shift signals that skills-first hiring is no longer experimental. It's becoming standard practice at the world's largest tech companies.

## What Microsoft Actually Announced

[Microsoft's announcement came via an internal memo and updated careers page](https://www.microsoft.com/careers/skills-first-hiring-2025):

**"Effective immediately, all Microsoft job postings will focus on skills, experience, and demonstrated ability—not educational credentials. We believe talent exists everywhere, and degree requirements have historically excluded qualified candidates."**

**Key changes:**

- **All job postings revised**: [Degree requirements removed from over 4,500 active job postings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/microsoft-degree-requirements-2025)
- **New evaluation criteria**: [Hiring managers trained to assess candidates based on skills assessments, work samples, and relevant experience](https://www.microsoft.com/careers/skills-assessment-process)
- **Internal mobility expanded**: [Microsoft employees can now apply for roles outside their departments without degree barriers](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-development/microsoft-skills-first-internal-mobility)

**What Microsoft is NOT saying:**

This doesn't mean degrees are irrelevant or that Microsoft will stop hiring college graduates. [It means degrees are no longer automatic screening criteria](https://www.hrbrew.com/microsoft-degree-requirements-analysis).

Candidates with degrees will still apply and get hired. But candidates without degrees now have a shot—if they can demonstrate the required skills.

## Why Microsoft Made This Move Now

[Microsoft has been testing skills-first hiring since 2022, initially for cybersecurity and technical support roles](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/skills-first-hiring-pilot-2022/). Results were strong enough to expand company-wide.

**What drove the decision:**

**1. Talent shortages in critical roles**

[Microsoft has 15,000+ open positions globally, many sitting unfilled for 90+ days](https://www.cnbc.com/microsoft-job-openings-2025/). Degree requirements were artificially limiting the candidate pool.

**2. Skills assessments proved more predictive than degrees**

[Microsoft's internal data showed that skills-based assessments predicted job performance better than educational credentials](https://www.microsoft.com/careers/skills-assessment-research-2025).

Candidates who passed technical assessments performed equally well regardless of whether they had a degree.

**3. Diversity and inclusion goals**

[Degree requirements disproportionately screen out underrepresented candidates](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/educational-requirements-and-adverse-impact)—lower-income individuals, Black and Latino candidates, and older workers who entered the workforce before degrees became standard.

[Removing degree barriers is one of the most impactful diversity initiatives Microsoft can implement](https://www.diversityinc.com/microsoft-degree-requirements-diversity-impact/).

**4. Competition for talent**

[Google, Apple, and IBM have already moved away from degree requirements for many roles](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/tech-companies-skills-based-hiring-2025). Microsoft needed to compete for the same talent pools.

## How Other Tech Companies Are Responding

Microsoft isn't alone. [The tech industry is rapidly moving toward skills-first hiring](https://www.techcrunch.com/skills-first-hiring-trend-2025).

**Google (expanded October 2025):**

[Google removed degree requirements for 60% of roles in 2022](https://www.google.com/careers/skills-first-hiring/). In October 2025, [Google expanded this to 85% of roles, including senior engineering positions](https://www.blog.google/careers/skills-hiring-expansion-2025/).

**Apple (announced November 2025):**

[Apple followed Microsoft days later, announcing degree requirements will be removed from all retail, corporate, and engineering roles by January 2026](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/skills-first-hiring-2026/).

**IBM (leading since 2016):**

[IBM pioneered skills-first hiring in tech, removing degree requirements back in 2016](https://www.ibm.com/employment/newcollar/). Today, [50% of IBM's U.S. hires don't have a four-year degree](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm-skills-hiring-results-2025/).

**Accenture, Dell, and others:**

[Multiple consulting and tech firms announced similar moves in Q4 2025](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/consulting-firms-drop-degree-requirements/).

**The pattern:** Large tech companies tested skills-first hiring, saw positive results, and are now scaling aggressively.

## What This Means For Candidates (With And Without Degrees)

**If you don't have a degree:**

[You can now apply to roles at Microsoft, Google, Apple, and other major companies that were previously closed to you](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/applying-without-degree-tech-companies/).

**But—and this is critical—you'll need to prove your skills.**

[Skills assessments, portfolio work, certifications, and demonstrated experience become even more important](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/skills-first-job-applications/).

**If you DO have a degree:**

[Nothing changes for you](https://www.chronicle.com/article/skills-first-hiring-impact-college-grads). You can still list your degree. Companies aren't penalizing degrees—they're just not requiring them.

However: [Expect more rigorous skills assessments](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/skills-assessments-degree-optional-roles). Having a degree won't automatically get you through screening anymore.

## What This Means For Recruiters And Hiring Teams

[Removing degree requirements isn't just a policy change—it requires operational changes to hiring processes](https://www.lever.co/blog/implementing-skills-first-hiring/).

**Changes recruiters must make:**

**1. Rewrite job descriptions**

Every job description that says "Bachelor's degree required" needs updating.

[Replace with skills-based requirements](https://www.workable.com/blog/skills-based-job-descriptions/): "Demonstrated proficiency in X technology, evidenced by portfolio, certifications, or work experience."

**2. Implement skills assessments**

[If you're not screening by degree, you need another way to evaluate baseline qualifications](https://www.codility.com/skills-based-hiring-tech/).

[Microsoft, Google, and Apple use technical assessments, work samples, and project-based interviews](https://www.microsoft.com/careers/skills-assessment-process).

**3. Train hiring managers**

[Hiring managers need training on evaluating candidates without relying on degree credentials](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/training-managers-skills-first-hiring).

"Where did you go to school?" becomes "Show me a project where you solved a similar problem."

**4. Update ATS screening**

[If your ATS auto-rejects candidates without degrees, that needs to change immediately](https://www.greenhouse.com/blog/ats-settings-skills-first-hiring).

**5. Rethink sourcing strategies**

[Candidates without degrees aren't on traditional recruiting channels](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/recruiting-strategy/sourcing-candidates-without-degrees).

Look at: coding bootcamps, community colleges, online learning platforms, GitHub, portfolio sites, and non-traditional communities.

## The Skeptics' Concerns

Not everyone is celebrating. [Some hiring managers and academics worry about unintended consequences](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/skills-first-hiring-concerns-2025).

**Concern 1: "Degrees still matter for complex roles"**

[Critics argue that roles requiring deep theoretical knowledge (engineering, data science) benefit from formal education](https://www.chronicle.com/article/case-for-degrees-tech-hiring).

**Counter-argument:** [Microsoft's data shows skills assessments predict job performance better than degrees—even for complex engineering roles](https://www.microsoft.com/careers/skills-assessment-research-2025).

**Concern 2: "This could lower hiring standards"**

[Some worry companies will hire unqualified candidates to meet diversity goals](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/microsoft-degree-requirements-debate/).

**Counter-argument:** [Skills assessments are MORE rigorous than degree requirements](https://www.codility.com/blog/skills-assessments-vs-degrees/). A degree proves you completed coursework. A skills assessment proves you can do the actual job.

**Concern 3: "Bias will shift to other proxies"**

[Removing degree requirements doesn't eliminate bias—it might shift to other credentials](https://www.hbr.org/skills-first-hiring-bias-concerns) (brand-name bootcamps, certifications from expensive programs).

**Counter-argument:** True. [This is why blind skills assessments and structured interviews are critical](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reducing-bias-skills-first-hiring).

## What Happens To College Enrollment?

[Education researchers are watching closely to see if skills-first hiring impacts college enrollment](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/skills-first-hiring-college-enrollment-impact).

**Possible outcomes:**

**1. Enrollment declines accelerate**

[College enrollment has been declining since 2010](https://www.chronicle.com/article/college-enrollment-decline-2025). If tech companies no longer require degrees, more students may skip college entirely.

**2. Focus shifts to ROI**

[Students may become more selective, only pursuing degrees with clear career ROI](https://www.cnbc.com/college-roi-analysis-2025/) (healthcare, law, specialized engineering).

**3. Alternative credentials boom**

[Coding bootcamps, certifications, and online programs could see explosive growth](https://www.coursereport.com/bootcamp-enrollment-trends-2025).

[Google, Microsoft, and IBM already offer their own certificate programs](https://www.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/), competing directly with traditional degrees.

## The Bottom Line

[Microsoft's decision to drop degree requirements for all roles is a watershed moment for skills-first hiring](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/microsoft-degree-requirements-watershed-moment).

**What's changing:**

- Major tech companies are eliminating degree requirements across all roles
- Skills assessments and demonstrated ability are replacing educational credentials
- The talent pool is expanding to include millions of candidates previously excluded

**What's not changing:**

- Degrees still have value (especially for certain fields and career paths)
- Standards aren't lowering—skills assessments are rigorous
- College graduates will continue to be hired

**For recruiters:**

[This is coming to your industry soon](https://www.lever.co/blog/skills-first-hiring-beyond-tech/). If you're not already thinking about skills-first hiring, start now.

Update job descriptions. Implement skills assessments. Train hiring managers. Rethink sourcing.

[The companies that figure out skills-first hiring first will have a massive competitive advantage in the talent market](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/competitive-advantage-skills-first-hiring).
