The talent war just went nuclear. [Employee poaching litigation cases increased 67% in 2025 compared to last year](https://www.law360.com/articles/employee-poaching-litigation-2025), with companies filing lawsuits against competitors who hire their workers, employees who dare to switch jobs, and recruiters who facilitate the moves.

[Non-compete agreements are being invalidated by courts and banned by states at record rates](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/non-compete-ban-update-2025), but companies are throwing legal spaghetti at the wall anyway—hoping lawsuits will scare employees into staying and competitors into backing off.

**Spoiler: it's mostly not working, but it's making everyone's lives miserable.**

## The Numbers Are Staggering

[Corporate litigation over employee departures hit an all-time high in 2025](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/risk-management/employee-departure-litigation-trends-2025):

**Trade secret claims**: [Up 43% year-over-year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trade-secret-litigation-increase-2025/). Companies allege departing employees took proprietary information, client lists, or confidential data.

**Breach of contract lawsuits**: [Increased 52%](https://www.law360.com/articles/breach-contract-employee-litigation). Typically targeting non-compete, non-solicit, or confidentiality agreements.

**Tortious interference claims**: [Up 71%](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/tortious-interference-hiring-2025). Companies suing competitors for "improperly inducing" employees to leave.

**Injunctions sought**: [Courts received 3,200+ requests for temporary restraining orders to block employees from starting new jobs](https://www.law360.com/articles/tro-employment-cases-2025), a 58% increase from 2024.

[The average legal cost to defend against an employment departure lawsuit: $180,000-350,000](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/employment-litigation-costs-2025). [Most cases settle before trial, but not before burning significant time and money](https://www.law360.com/articles/employment-litigation-settlement-rates).

## Why This Is Exploding Now

Several factors converged to create this litigation tsunami:

**Talent shortages make poaching essential**: [Companies can't hire fast enough organically, so they're aggressively recruiting from competitors](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/competitive-recruiting-2025). [When you can't build talent, you buy it—usually from your direct competitors](https://www.hrdive.com/news/talent-poaching-strategies-2025/).

**Non-competes are dying legally**: [The FTC attempted a nationwide non-compete ban in 2024 (currently in litigation)](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/ftc-non-compete-ban-update). [Even before that, states like California, North Dakota, and Oklahoma banned most non-competes](https://www.ncsl.org/labor-and-employment/noncompete-agreements-state-laws). [Courts are increasingly refusing to enforce them](https://www.law360.com/articles/non-compete-enforcement-decline-2025).

**Companies are weaponizing what's left**: [Since non-competes aren't working, companies are pivoting to trade secret and tortious interference claims](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trade-secret-alternative-non-compete/). [These don't require a signed agreement and can target the hiring company, not just the employee](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/trade-secret-claims-employee-departures).

**Remote work makes geography irrelevant**: [Employees used to be protected by distance—moving out of state meant your old employer couldn't easily enforce agreements](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/remote-work-geographic-protections). [Now everyone works remotely, so departing employees are immediate competitive threats regardless of location](https://www.hrdive.com/news/remote-work-non-compete-enforcement/).

**Executive and technical talent is scarce**: [Most litigation focuses on high-value employees—executives, engineers, sales leaders](https://www.law360.com/articles/high-value-employee-litigation-2025). [Companies are willing to spend $300K in legal fees to block a competitor from hiring a $200K engineer who knows their roadmap](https://www.forbes.com/sites/executive-departure-litigation-roi/).

## The Cases Getting Ugly

Real examples from 2025 illustrate how nasty this is getting:

[Major tech company sued a competitor for hiring 12 engineers over six months, alleging systematic "raiding"](https://www.law360.com/articles/tech-company-raiding-lawsuit-2025). [Case included claims of recruiters coordinating departures, employees taking source code, and deliberate attempts to sabotage product development](https://www.techlawjournal.com/tech-raiding-case-2025).

[Financial services firm obtained a TRO blocking a departing wealth manager from starting at a competitor for 90 days](https://www.law360.com/articles/wealth-manager-tro-case-2025). [Manager had no non-compete but company alleged she downloaded client lists two weeks before resignation](https://www.investmentnews.com/practice-management/wealth-manager-litigation-2025).

[Manufacturing company sued both a departing VP of Sales and the company that hired him](https://www.law360.com/articles/manufacturing-vp-sales-lawsuit-2025). [Claimed the hiring company "knew or should have known" about restrictive covenants and deliberately interfered](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/tortious-interference-standard-2025). [VP ended up in legal limbo for four months—couldn't work for new employer, couldn't return to old one](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/risk-management/employment-litigation-limbo-2025).

[Pharmaceutical company sued a research scientist for alleged trade secret theft](https://www.law360.com/articles/pharma-trade-secret-scientist-2025). [Scientist's laptop showed she accessed research databases the week before her resignation](https://www.pharmalive.com/trade-secret-litigation-researcher/). [She claimed she was reviewing her own work for reference—company claimed she was stealing drug formulation data](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/pharmaceutical-trade-secrets-litigation).

## The Chilling Effect On Recruiting

This litigation wave is creating massive problems for recruiters and hiring companies:

**Due diligence paralysis**: [Companies are requiring extensive legal review before making offers to candidates with potential restrictive covenants](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/restrictive-covenant-due-diligence). [Some are refusing to hire anyone with a non-compete, regardless of enforceability](https://www.hrdive.com/news/non-compete-hiring-risk-aversion/).

**Delayed start dates**: [Candidates are negotiating 60-90 day notice periods to minimize litigation risk](https://www.law360.com/articles/extended-notice-periods-2025). [Some companies won't allow new hires to start until non-compete periods fully expire](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/non-compete-waiting-periods).

**Indemnification demands**: [Candidates are asking new employers to indemnify them against litigation costs from prior employers](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/indemnification-clauses-employment-2025). [Some companies are agreeing to cover legal fees—others are walking away from candidates with significant legal risk](https://www.hrdive.com/news/legal-indemnification-hiring-2025/).

**Recruiter liability concerns**: [Third-party recruiters are being named in lawsuits for "facilitating" unlawful departures](https://www.law360.com/articles/recruiter-liability-employee-poaching-2025). [Recruiters are now requiring candidates to warrant they're not subject to enforceable restrictive covenants](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-legal-risk-non-competes/).

**Reference check complications**: [Companies are refusing to serve as references or confirm employment dates for fear of being pulled into litigation](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/reference-check-complications-litigation).

## What Courts Are Actually Doing

Despite the surge in lawsuits, courts aren't necessarily cooperating:

[Court enforcement rates for non-competes continue declining—only 32% of non-compete injunction requests were granted in 2025, down from 48% in 2023](https://www.law360.com/articles/non-compete-injunction-grant-rates-2025).

[Courts are increasingly applying "reasonableness" standards that most agreements fail](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/non-compete-reasonableness-standards-2025): [Too broad geographically? Denied](https://www.law360.com/articles/non-compete-geographic-scope-2025). [Too long in duration? Denied](https://www.law360.com/articles/non-compete-duration-limits). [Restricts all work in an industry? Denied](https://www.law360.com/articles/non-compete-scope-limitations).

[Trade secret claims are having more success—but only when companies can prove actual misappropriation](https://www.law360.com/articles/trade-secret-enforcement-2025). [General knowledge, skills, and relationships don't qualify as trade secrets](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/trade-secret-definition-employment-2025). [You need to show the employee took specific proprietary information](https://www.law360.com/articles/trade-secret-evidence-requirements).

**The strategy for many companies isn't to win—it's to make leaving so painful that employees don't try.**

## State-By-State Chaos

Non-compete enforceability varies wildly by state, creating compliance nightmares:

**States that ban or severely restrict non-competes**: [California, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado, Illinois](https://www.ncsl.org/labor-and-employment/noncompete-agreements-state-laws). [Non-competes are generally unenforceable except for sale of business](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/non-compete-state-bans-2025).

**States with moderate enforcement**: [Most states enforce "reasonable" non-competes but define reasonable differently](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/state-non-compete-law-variations-2025). [Typical limits: 1-2 years duration, limited geography, narrow scope](https://www.law360.com/articles/reasonable-non-compete-standards-by-state).

**States with strong enforcement**: [Florida, Georgia, Texas historically enforce non-competes more broadly](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/non-compete-enforcement-by-state). [But even these states are trending toward stricter standards](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/non-compete-enforcement-trends-2025).

**Choice of law battles**: [Many employment agreements specify which state's law applies](https://www.law360.com/articles/choice-of-law-employment-agreements). [Employees are arguing these clauses should be invalidated when they conflict with the state where the employee works](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/choice-of-law-employment-litigation).

**Remote work complicates everything**: [If you work remotely for a California company while living in Florida, which state's law applies?](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/remote-work-choice-of-law-issues) [Courts are split, creating uncertainty](https://www.law360.com/articles/remote-work-non-compete-jurisdiction).

## What Employees Should Do

If you're considering leaving a job with a restrictive covenant:

**Get a lawyer before accepting a new offer**: [$2,000 now beats $200,000 in litigation costs later](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/employee-legal-review-restrictive-covenants).

**Review what you signed**: [Non-compete? Non-solicit? Confidentiality? Know what you're bound by](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/understanding-restrictive-covenants-employment).

**Don't take anything**: [No client lists, no documents, no emails forwarded to personal accounts](https://www.law360.com/articles/trade-secret-litigation-avoidance). [This is where winnable cases become loseable](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/risk-management/data-theft-employment-departure).

**Negotiate indemnification**: [Ask your new employer to cover legal costs if your old employer sues](https://www.hrdive.com/news/employee-indemnification-negotiation/).

**Extended notice can help**: [Longer transition periods reduce claims that you sabotaged your old employer or stole opportunities](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/extended-notice-period-benefits).

## What Hiring Companies Should Do

If you're recruiting from competitors:

**Legal review before offers**: [Have employment counsel review candidates' agreements](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/pre-hire-legal-review-restrictive-covenants). [$5K in legal fees beats $300K in litigation](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/pre-hire-risk-mitigation-strategies).

**Indemnification provisions**: [Decide your policy on covering employees' legal costs](https://www.hrdive.com/news/employer-indemnification-policies/). [Document it clearly in offer letters](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indemnification-offer-letters).

**Clean room protocols**: [Implement policies to prevent use of prior employer's confidential information](https://www.law360.com/articles/clean-room-procedures-hiring). [Train new hires on what they can't use or reference](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/trade-secret-protection-onboarding).

**Document legitimate recruiting**: [Keep records showing you recruited through normal channels, didn't coordinate mass departures, and didn't solicit confidential information](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/risk-management/litigation-defense-documentation-recruiting).

**Consider timing**: [Wait for non-compete periods to expire when possible](https://www.hrdive.com/news/non-compete-waiting-periods-hiring/). [Extended start dates are better than litigation](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/delayed-start-dates-risk-mitigation).

## The Bottom Line

[Employee poaching litigation is the new front in the war for talent](https://www.law360.com/articles/employment-litigation-trends-2025). [Companies that can't retain workers through culture, compensation, or opportunity are trying to retain them through legal threats](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-hr-strategy/litigation-retention-strategy).

[Most of these lawsuits won't succeed in court, but they don't need to—they just need to create enough friction to discourage job switches](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/employment-litigation-strategic-use).

For recruiters: [Know the law in your state, review candidates' agreements, document clean recruiting practices, and prepare for legal involvement to become standard in competitive hiring](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-guide-employment-litigation-2025).
