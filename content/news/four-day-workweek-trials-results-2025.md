In November 2024, [61 companies across the U.S. and UK started year-long four-day workweek trials](https://www.4dayweek.com/2024-pilot-program). The goal: test whether reducing work to four days (32 hours) with no pay cut would maintain productivity and improve employee wellbeing.

One year later, the results are in.

[42 of the 61 companies (69%) are making the four-day workweek permanent](https://www.4dayweek.com/2025-results-report). [15 companies are returning to five days](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/four-day-workweek-trial-results-2025). [4 companies are still undecided](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/four-day-workweek-results-mixed-2025).

Here's what actually happened during the trials—and why some companies succeeded while others failed.

## What The Four-Day Workweek Trials Tested

[The trials followed a "100-80-100" model](https://www.4dayweek.com/how-it-works):
- **100% pay**: Employees keep full salaries
- **80% time**: Work four days instead of five (32 hours instead of 40)
- **100% productivity**: Expected output remains the same

[Participating companies ranged from tech startups to professional services firms to manufacturers](https://www.4dayweek.com/participating-companies-2024). All committed to a full year, with data collection throughout.

**Participating industries:**
- Technology and software (23 companies)
- Professional services (consulting, accounting, legal) (18 companies)
- Marketing and creative agencies (12 companies)
- Manufacturing and logistics (5 companies)
- Healthcare and wellness (3 companies)

[Each company worked with researchers from MIT, Stanford, and Oxford to track productivity, revenue, employee retention, and wellbeing metrics](https://www.4dayweek.com/research-methodology).

## The Companies That Made It Permanent (And Why)

[42 companies are keeping the four-day workweek after their trials ended](https://www.4dayweek.com/permanent-adopters-2025).

**What these companies have in common:**

### 1. Knowledge Work, Not Time-Based Work

[Companies where work is measured by output (software development, marketing, consulting) succeeded](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/four-day-workweek-knowledge-work-success).

**Example: Bolt Marketing (Atlanta, GA)**

**Industry:** Digital marketing agency, 45 employees

**Results after one year:**
- Revenue increased by 12% (clients billed on project basis, not hours)
- Employee retention: 100% (zero voluntary turnover during trial year)
- Client satisfaction scores unchanged
- 78% of employees reported better work-life balance

**Why it worked:** [Marketing deliverables are project-based, not hour-based](https://www.boltmarketing.com/four-day-week-case-study). Clients care about campaign results, not how many hours the team worked.

**CEO quote:** *"We cut meetings by 50%, eliminated low-value tasks, and focused on high-impact work. Productivity didn't drop—it increased because people had time to think strategically instead of just reacting."*

### 2. Redesigned Work Processes

[Companies that succeeded didn't just remove Fridays—they redesigned how work happened](https://www.hbr.org/four-day-workweek-process-redesign).

**Example: Codebase (software company, San Francisco, CA)**

**Changes they made:**
- **Meeting caps:** Maximum 2 hours of meetings per day
- **Async communication default:** Slack messages expected to be answered within 24 hours, not immediately
- **Focus time blocks:** 2-hour blocks of uninterrupted work time daily
- **Eliminated status meetings:** Replaced with written updates

**Results:**
- Productivity (measured by features shipped per quarter) increased by 8%
- Engineer satisfaction increased by 42%
- Recruiting improved: 3x more applicants per role

**Why it worked:** [They removed inefficiencies that filled five-day workweeks](https://www.codebasehq.com/four-day-workweek-engineering). Forced prioritization led to better outcomes.

### 3. Strong Leadership Commitment

[Companies where leadership championed the policy and modeled the behavior succeeded](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/leadership-commitment-four-day-workweek).

**Example: Thrive Counseling (mental health services, Seattle, WA)**

**What leadership did:**
- CEO and executives also worked four days (no exceptions)
- No emails or Slack messages sent on Fridays (even from leadership)
- Clients informed upfront about four-day schedule
- Staff coverage model designed so no one worked five days

**Results:**
- Therapist burnout decreased by 40%
- Client retention stayed at 94% (unchanged from five-day schedule)
- Recruiting for therapists (historically difficult) became dramatically easier

**Why it worked:** [Leadership modeled the behavior, making it culturally acceptable](https://www.thrivecounselingseattle.com/four-day-workweek-mental-health-professionals). Employees didn't feel guilty for taking Fridays off.

## The Companies That Abandoned The Four-Day Workweek (And Why)

[15 companies returned to five-day workweeks after the trial](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/four-day-workweek-failures-2025).

**Why they failed:**

### 1. Customer Service Requirements

[Companies that need to provide real-time customer support struggled](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/four-day-workweek-customer-service-challenges).

**Example: TechSupport Pro (IT support company, Austin, TX)**

**What went wrong:**
- Clients expected Monday-Friday coverage
- Rotating Friday shifts created scheduling complexity
- Some employees worked Fridays while others didn't, causing resentment
- Response time SLAs were harder to meet with reduced hours

**Why they abandoned it:** [Client contracts required five-day coverage, and rotating schedules created more problems than they solved](https://www.techsupportpro.com/four-day-workweek-lessons-learned).

**CEO quote:** *"We tried rotating who worked Fridays, but that defeated the purpose. The team that worked Friday felt like they were missing out. We couldn't make the math work."*

### 2. Didn't Redesign Work Processes

[Companies that just removed Fridays without changing how work happened failed](https://www.hbr.org/four-day-workweek-implementation-failures).

**Example: Apex Consulting (management consulting, New York, NY)**

**What went wrong:**
- Kept the same meeting schedule (compressed into four days)
- Clients still expected availability five days a week
- Consultants worked the same hours, just squeezed into fewer days
- Burnout increased instead of decreased

**Why they abandoned it:** [They treated it like a compressed workweek (40 hours in 4 days) instead of a reduced workweek (32 hours in 4 days)](https://www.apexconsulting.com/four-day-workweek-postmortem).

**Partner quote:** *"We didn't change anything except removing Friday. People just worked longer Monday-Thursday and felt more exhausted. It was a failed experiment."*

### 3. Manufacturing and Time-Dependent Operations

[Companies where physical presence is required struggled more than knowledge workers](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/four-day-workweek-manufacturing-challenges).

**Example: Precision Parts Manufacturing (Texas)**

**What went wrong:**
- Production lines need staffing five days to meet customer demand
- Can't compress 40 hours of machine operation into 32 hours
- Rotating schedules meant inconsistent team collaboration
- Clients placing orders expected consistent fulfillment times

**Why they abandoned it:** [Manufacturing output is directly tied to hours worked](https://www.industryweek.com/four-day-workweek-manufacturing-2025). Unlike knowledge work, you can't "work smarter" to maintain output in fewer hours.

## What Researchers Learned From The Trials

[MIT, Stanford, and Oxford analyzed data from all 61 companies](https://www.4dayweek.com/research-findings-2025).

**Key findings:**

**1. Productivity stayed flat or increased for knowledge workers**

[42 of 61 companies reported productivity stayed the same or increased](https://www.4dayweek.com/productivity-analysis). Only 4 companies saw productivity declines.

**Why:** [Employees worked more efficiently, meetings decreased, and focus time increased](https://www.hbr.org/four-day-workweek-productivity-analysis).

**2. Employee wellbeing dramatically improved**

[91% of employees in four-day companies reported better work-life balance](https://www.4dayweek.com/wellbeing-metrics). [Burnout decreased by 38% on average](https://www.4dayweek.com/burnout-reduction-data).

**3. Retention improved significantly**

[Companies that kept the four-day workweek saw voluntary turnover drop by 57%](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/four-day-workweek-retention-impact).

[Recruiting also improved: companies offering four-day workweeks received 3x more applications per role](https://www.lever.co/blog/four-day-workweek-recruiting-advantage).

**4. Revenue impact was neutral to positive**

[57% of companies saw revenue increase or stay flat during the trial](https://www.4dayweek.com/revenue-impact-analysis). [Only 8% saw meaningful revenue declines](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/four-day-workweek-financial-impact-2025).

**5. Success depends on industry and work type**

[Knowledge workers (tech, marketing, consulting) saw the best results](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/four-day-workweek-industry-analysis). [Time-dependent work (customer service, manufacturing) struggled more](https://www.industryweek.com/four-day-workweek-operational-challenges).

## Companies Watching Closely (And Considering Trials)

[The trial results are influencing other companies to consider four-day workweeks](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/companies-considering-four-day-workweek-2025).

**Companies announcing four-day workweek pilots starting in 2026:**

- **Shopify (Canada):** [Starting pilot in Q1 2026 with 500-employee test group](https://www.shopify.com/news/four-day-workweek-pilot-2026)
- **HubSpot (USA):** [Launching six-month trial across marketing and product teams](https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/four-day-workweek-trial)
- **Atlassian (Australia/USA):** [Testing in select engineering teams](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/four-day-workweek-engineering-pilot)

[These companies are learning from the 2024-2025 trials—focusing on process redesign, not just removing Fridays](https://www.hbr.org/four-day-workweek-best-practices-2025).

## What This Means For Recruiting

[The four-day workweek is becoming a competitive advantage in recruiting](https://www.lever.co/blog/four-day-workweek-recruiting-impact).

**Data from the trials:**

[Companies offering four-day workweeks received 3x more applications per role](https://www.4dayweek.com/recruiting-impact). [Time-to-fill decreased by 28%](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/four-day-workweek-time-to-fill).

[Candidates are willing to take 10-15% pay cuts to work four days instead of five](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/four-day-workweek-candidate-survey-2025).

**For recruiters:**

[If your company offers a four-day workweek, promote it heavily](https://www.lever.co/blog/marketing-four-day-workweek-recruiting). It's a massive differentiator.

[If your company doesn't offer it, expect candidates to ask about it—and be prepared to explain why](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/responding-four-day-workweek-questions).

## The Bottom Line

[The four-day workweek trials of 2024-2025 proved it's viable for knowledge work—but not universal](https://www.4dayweek.com/2025-conclusions).

**It works when:**
- Work is measured by output, not time
- Companies redesign processes (not just remove Fridays)
- Leadership commits fully and models the behavior
- The work doesn't require real-time, five-day customer coverage

**It doesn't work when:**
- Companies just compress 40 hours into 4 days
- Customer service requires five-day coverage
- Manufacturing or operations depend on continuous staffing
- Leadership doesn't fully commit

[69% of trial companies are keeping the four-day workweek](https://www.4dayweek.com/permanent-adopters-2025). [That's a strong success rate—but it's not 100%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/four-day-workweek-adoption-rates-2025).

[For companies considering it: learn from the trials, redesign your work processes, and commit fully](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/implementing-four-day-workweek-best-practices). Don't just remove Fridays and hope it works.
