The federal government is throwing money at infrastructure like it's 1950. [The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocated $1.2 trillion for roads, bridges, broadband, clean energy, and water systems](https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/). [The CHIPS and Science Act added another $280 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research](https://www.commerce.gov/chips).

That's $1.5 trillion in government spending flowing to contractors over the next decade.

The result? [Government contractors need to hire 1.2 million+ workers by 2027 to deliver on these contracts](https://www.agc.org/news/2025/02/government-infrastructure-jobs-hiring-demand/). Engineers, project managers, skilled trades, environmental specialists, cybersecurity professionals—the hiring needs are massive.

There's just one problem: **these people don't exist**.

[The unemployment rate for civil engineers is 1.8%](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172051.htm). [Skilled tradespeople are retiring faster than new workers are entering the field](https://www.constructiondive.com/news/skilled-trades-retirement-wave-2025/711234/). [Semiconductor engineers are being poached at record salaries before they even graduate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/semiconductor-engineering-talent-war-2025).

Government contractor recruiting has gone from a slow-moving niche to a cutthroat war where companies are paying signing bonuses that would make tech companies blush.

## The Numbers Are Absurd

[The Associated General Contractors of America estimates infrastructure projects will require 647,000 new construction workers by 2027](https://www.agc.org/news/2025/02/construction-workforce-demand-infrastructure-boom/). [That's on top of the 440,000 workers needed to replace retirements](https://www.constructiondive.com/news/construction-worker-shortage-retirement-2025/711456/).

**Breakdown by role:**

[Civil engineers: Need 145,000+ new hires by 2027](https://www.nspe.org/resources/press-room/resources/infrastructure-bill-civil-engineering-jobs). [Current pipeline produces 65,000 graduates per year, most of whom aren't going into infrastructure](https://www.asce.org/career-growth/civil-engineering-career-outlook-2025).

[Electrical and broadband technicians: Need 280,000+ for rural broadband expansion](https://www.ncta.com/broadband-workforce-demand-infrastructure-act). [Community colleges aren't producing enough trained technicians to meet demand](https://www.chronicle.com/article/broadband-technician-training-shortage).

[Project managers with federal contracting experience: Need 95,000+](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/government-contractor-project-management-demand-2025). [These roles require specific expertise in federal regulations, security clearances, and government procurement processes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/government-contractor-project-manager-shortage-2025).

[Environmental engineers and compliance specialists: Need 78,000+ for environmental reviews and permitting](https://www.environmentalcareer.com/infrastructure-environmental-jobs-demand-2025). [Every infrastructure project requires extensive environmental impact assessment and compliance](https://www.epa.gov/infrastructure/environmental-review-workforce-needs).

[Semiconductor fabrication technicians and engineers: Need 120,000+ for CHIPS Act manufacturing facilities](https://www.semiconductors.org/chips-act-workforce-challenges-2025/). [The U.S. hasn't built significant semiconductor capacity in 20 years—the workforce doesn't exist domestically](https://www.reuters.com/technology/semiconductor-manufacturing-workforce-gap-2025/).

[Cybersecurity professionals with government clearances: Need 85,000+ as infrastructure projects require security compliance](https://www.cyberscoop.com/government-contractor-cybersecurity-hiring-2025/). [Every contractor working on federal projects needs cleared security professionals](https://www.clearancejobs.com/security-clearance-jobs/infrastructure-cybersecurity-demand).

## The Salaries Have Gone Completely Insane

When demand massively exceeds supply, wages spike. Government contractor salaries are rising faster than almost any sector:

[Civil engineers with 3-5 years experience: $95K-$125K, up from $75K-$95K in 2023](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/civil-engineer-government-contractor-2025). [Senior engineers commanding $140K-$180K](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/senior-civil-engineer-government-contractor-salary-SRCH_KO0,44.htm). [That's 30-40% above private sector equivalents](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/government-contractor-salary-premium-2025).

[Project managers with active security clearances: $130K-$175K base salary](https://www.clearancejobs.com/jobs/project-manager-government-contractor-salary-2025). [Add 15-20% for Top Secret/SCI clearances](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/03/12/security-clearance-salary-premium-2025/). [Senior PMs with federal contracting experience pulling $200K+](https://www.indeed.com/career/senior-project-manager-government-contractor/salaries).

[Electrical technicians for broadband deployment: $65K-$85K, up from $48K-$62K in 2023](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes499051.htm). [Experienced techs with fiber installation expertise hitting $95K-$105K](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband-technician-salaries-infrastructure-boom-2025).

[Semiconductor fabrication engineers: $115K-$165K for mid-level roles](https://www.semiconductors.org/semiconductor-engineer-compensation-2025/). [Senior engineers with cleanroom and yield optimization experience commanding $180K-$240K](https://www.semiwiki.com/forum/content/11234-semiconductor-engineer-salary-war-2025.html). [Some facilities offering $50K+ signing bonuses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/semiconductor-manufacturing-signing-bonuses-2025).

[Environmental compliance specialists with NEPA experience: $85K-$115K](https://www.environmentalcareer.com/environmental-compliance-salaries-2025). [Senior environmental engineers $125K-$160K](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172081.htm).

**Signing bonuses are becoming standard**: [Many contractors offering $10K-$50K signing bonuses depending on role and clearance level](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/government-contractor-signing-bonus-trend-2025). [Relocation packages up to $20K for hard-to-fill positions](https://www.hrdive.com/news/government-contractor-relocation-benefits-2025/711789/).

## The Security Clearance Bottleneck

Here's a massive problem: [many government contractor roles require security clearances, and getting cleared takes 6-18 months](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/02/security-clearance-processing-times-2025/).

[The government processes about 750,000 clearance investigations per year](https://www.dcsa.mil/About/Frequently-Asked-Questions/). [Infrastructure projects need an estimated 300,000+ additional cleared workers by 2027](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/03/infrastructure-security-clearance-demand/).

**The math doesn't work.**

[Contractors are hiring people contingent on clearance approval, then waiting months for background investigations to complete](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/security-clearance-hiring-contingencies-2025). [Many candidates accept other offers while waiting for clearance processing](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/03/clearance-processing-delays-candidate-dropoff/).

[The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) is trying to expedite processing, but they're overwhelmed](https://www.dcsa.mil/News-Events/press-releases/infrastructure-clearance-processing-expansion/). [Average processing time for Secret clearances: 4-6 months. Top Secret: 9-14 months. Top Secret/SCI: 12-18 months](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/02/security-clearance-timelines-by-level-2025/).

**The clearance salary premium is real**: [Workers with active clearances command 15-25% higher salaries than equivalent non-cleared roles](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/01/security-clearance-salary-premium-analysis-2025/). [That's pure supply and demand—cleared workers are scarce and contractors can't wait months to fill roles](https://www.hrdive.com/news/security-clearance-compensation-premium-government-contractors/711901/).

## Where The Jobs Are Located

Infrastructure spending isn't evenly distributed. [Some metros are seeing massive contractor hiring while others barely register](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/infrastructure-jobs-geographic-distribution-2025/):

**Washington DC metro area**: [Leading government contractor hiring with 145,000+ projected hires by 2027](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/dc-area-government-contractor-job-growth/). [Cybersecurity, project management, compliance, and administrative support roles concentrated here](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2025/03/government-contractor-hiring-surge-dc.html).

**Texas (Dallas, Houston, Austin)**: [Semiconductor manufacturing expansion under CHIPS Act creating 85,000+ jobs](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/technology/2025/03/texas-semiconductor-jobs-infrastructure-boom/). [Texas Instruments, Samsung, Intel all building major facilities](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/16/texas-semiconductor-manufacturing-expansion/).

**Arizona (Phoenix, Tucson)**: [TSMC building massive fabrication plants, creating 55,000+ jobs](https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/tech/2025/03/tsmc-arizona-jobs-semiconductor-expansion/). [Combination of direct manufacturing roles and supporting contractor positions](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2025/03/semiconductor-contractor-jobs-arizona.html).

**Rural broadband expansion areas**: [Dispersed across Midwest, Southeast, and Mountain West](https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/resources/broadband-infrastructure-projects-map). [Technicians needed everywhere from Montana to Mississippi](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/broadband/rural-broadband-job-creation-infrastructure-act).

**Major transportation corridors**: [Highway and bridge projects concentrated in Northeast Corridor, Great Lakes, and West Coast](https://www.transportation.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/key-projects-map). [Civil engineers, construction managers, and environmental specialists needed regionally](https://www.enr.com/articles/55789-infrastructure-jobs-transportation-corridor-focus).

## The Contractor Recruiting Wars

Competition for talent is getting nasty. [Traditional government contractors (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Bechtel) are competing with tech companies, construction firms, and new market entrants](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/government-contractor-recruiting-competition/).

**Poaching is rampant**: [Companies are cold-calling employees at competitors offering 20-30% raises to switch jobs](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/government-contractor-poaching-epidemic-2025). [LinkedIn InMails from contractor recruiters have become relentless for anyone with relevant keywords on their profile](https://www.ere.net/government-contractor-recruiter-aggressive-sourcing-tactics-2025/).

**Referral bonuses are hitting record levels**: [$5K-$15K for successful hires in hard-to-fill roles](https://www.hrdive.com/news/government-contractor-referral-bonus-escalation/712123/). [Some contractors offering $25K+ for engineers with active Top Secret clearances](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/03/government-contractor-referral-bonuses-cleared-engineers/).

**Retention bonuses kicking in**: [Contractors are paying retention bonuses to keep critical staff from being poached](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/government-contractor-retention-bonuses-2025). [$10K-$40K retention payments for staying through project milestones](https://www.hrdive.com/news/retention-bonus-trend-government-contractors/712234/).

**Companies lowering experience requirements**: [Roles that used to require 7-10 years experience now accepting 3-5 years](https://www.ere.net/government-contractor-experience-requirement-relaxation-2025/). [Some contractors hiring recent graduates and providing intensive training rather than waiting for experienced candidates who don't exist](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/government-contractor-entry-level-hiring-expansion-2025).

## The Skills Gap Is Real

Even with higher salaries and relaxed requirements, fundamental skills gaps remain:

**Nobody's teaching government contracting**: [Most engineering and project management programs don't cover federal acquisition regulations (FAR), cost accounting standards, or security compliance](https://www.projectmanagement.com/blog-post/67234/government-contracting-curriculum-gap). [New hires need 6-18 months on-the-job training to understand government contracting processes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/government-contractor-onboarding-training-duration-2025).

**Security clearance eligible pool is limited**: [Approximately 70% of Americans aged 18-24 would not qualify for military service due to criminal records, drug use, poor physical fitness, or lack of education](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/the-looming-national-security-crisis-young-americans-unable-serve-the-military). [Security clearance requirements are similarly restrictive](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/01/security-clearance-eligibility-statistics-2025/). [This eliminates a large portion of potential candidates before recruiting even begins](https://www.clearancejobs.com/security-clearance-eligibility-factors).

**Trades training has collapsed**: [Vocational and technical education programs shrank by 60% since 1990 as education policy emphasized college degrees](https://www.jff.org/news/vocational-education-decline-impact-infrastructure-workforce/). [Community colleges are scrambling to rebuild trades programs but can't scale fast enough](https://www.chronicle.com/article/community-colleges-infrastructure-trades-training-expansion).

**Semiconductor expertise doesn't exist domestically**: [The U.S. outsourced semiconductor manufacturing for 25+ years](https://www.semiconductors.org/us-semiconductor-manufacturing-decline-analysis/). [The technicians and engineers with fabrication expertise are overwhelmingly in Taiwan, South Korea, and China](https://www.reuters.com/technology/semiconductor-talent-international-recruitment-2025/). [U.S. companies are recruiting internationally and providing visa sponsorship, but it's slow and complex](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/semiconductor-international-recruitment-visa-challenges-2025).

## What Contractors Are Trying (And What's Not Working)

**Apprenticeship programs**: [Major contractors are building multi-year apprenticeships to develop talent from scratch](https://www.constructiondive.com/news/construction-apprenticeship-expansion-government-contractors/712456/). [Bechtel, Fluor, and Kiewit have launched large-scale programs](https://www.agc.org/news/2025/03/contractor-apprenticeship-programs-infrastructure-workforce/). [Early results are promising but these programs take 3-5 years to produce fully trained workers](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/apprenticeship-workforce-development-timeline-2025). [Infrastructure projects starting now can't wait that long](https://www.enr.com/articles/55890-apprenticeship-programs-wont-solve-immediate-workforce-shortage).

**Military veteran recruitment**: [Contractors are aggressively recruiting transitioning service members](https://www.hiringourheroes.org/government-contractor-veteran-hiring-2025/). [Many veterans have clearances and relevant technical skills](https://www.military.com/veteran-jobs/government-contractor-opportunities-veterans-2025.html). [But there aren't enough veterans separating annually to fill contractor needs](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military). [About 200,000 service members transition annually—contractors need 1.2 million workers](https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/military-to-civilian-transition-statistics-2025/).

**International recruitment**: [Some contractors recruiting engineers from Canada, UK, Australia, and EU countries](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/government-contractor-international-hiring-expansion-2025). [Visa sponsorship is expensive and time-consuming, and security clearances for non-U.S. citizens are extremely limited](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations). [This works for some roles but not most cleared positions](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/02/foreign-nationals-security-clearance-limitations/).

**Trying to lure private sector talent**: [Contractors pitching "mission-driven work" and "job security" to attract private sector engineers and project managers](https://www.ere.net/government-contractor-recruiting-private-sector-talent-2025/). [Mixed results—private sector pays better and has less bureaucracy](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/private-sector-vs-government-contractor-comparison-2025/). [Many private sector workers aren't interested in government contracting culture](https://www.hrdive.com/news/government-contractor-employer-brand-challenges/712789/).

**Remote work options**: [Some contractors offering remote work to access talent nationwide](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/government-contractor-remote-work-policies-2025). [But many roles require physical presence on job sites or in secured facilities](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2025/02/government-contractor-remote-work-clearance-restrictions/). [Remote work helps for some administrative and engineering roles but not construction, installation, or highly classified work](https://www.constructiondive.com/news/remote-work-limitations-construction-government-contracting/712901/).

## The Project Delays Are Already Starting

[Insufficient workforce is already causing infrastructure project delays](https://www.enr.com/articles/55991-infrastructure-projects-delayed-workforce-shortages):

[Broadband expansion projects in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho delayed 6-12 months due to technician shortages](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/broadband/rural-broadband-projects-delayed-workforce-shortage). [States can't deploy allocated federal funding because contractors can't staff projects](https://www.statetech.us/broadband-funding-deployment-delays-workforce-2025/).

## The Bottom Line

The federal government is spending $1.5 trillion on infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing. Government contractors have secured hundreds of billions in contracts.

But [they can't deliver on those contracts without workers who don't exist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/government-contractor-workforce-crisis/).

Salaries are spiking, companies are poaching each other's employees, and projects are getting delayed because there simply aren't enough qualified people to hire.

For recruiters working in government contracting: your job security has never been better, and your hiring targets have never been harder.

For everyone else: if you have a security clearance and any relevant skills, your phone is about to start ringing off the hook.
