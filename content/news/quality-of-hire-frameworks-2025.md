Recruiting metrics have been broken for decades. Companies obsess over time-to-fill (how fast can we fill this role?) and cost-per-hire (how cheap can we make this?) while completely ignoring the metric that actually determines whether a hire was successful: quality of hire.

[In 2025, that's finally changing](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/trends/quality-of-hire-measurement). Companies are building sophisticated frameworks to measure whether the people they hire actually perform, stay, and contribute to business outcomes. And if you're still measuring recruiting success by how quickly you fill seats, you're about to get left behind.

## Why Quality of Hire Suddenly Matters

The shift isn't happening because companies suddenly had an epiphany about good recruiting. [It's happening because bad hires are getting too expensive to ignore](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cost-of-bad-hire-2025).

[The cost of a bad hire now averages 30% of that employee's first-year salary when you factor in recruiting costs, onboarding, lost productivity, and the cost of replacing them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cost-of-bad-hire-2025). For a $100K employee, that's $30K down the drain. For leadership roles, it's significantly worse.

And bad hires aren't rare. [Studies show that 46% of new hires fail within 18 months](https://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/why-new-hires-fail). That means nearly half of the people companies hire either quit, get fired, or underperform to the point where they're effectively deadweight.

[In an economic environment where companies are doing more with less, hiring someone who doesn't perform isn't just wasteful—it's catastrophic](https://www.mercer.com/insights/people-strategy/future-of-work/quality-of-hire-business-impact). Leadership teams are finally asking the uncomfortable question: "Are we actually hiring good people, or are we just filling seats quickly?"

## What Quality of Hire Actually Measures

Here's the problem: [there's no universal definition of quality of hire](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/how-to-measure-quality-of-hire). Every company defines it differently based on what they value.

But the best frameworks measure some combination of these factors:

**Performance ratings**: How do new hires perform in their first 12-18 months compared to expectations? Are they meeting goals, exceeding them, or struggling?

**Retention**: Do new hires stay or leave? High turnover in new hires signals either bad selection or bad onboarding.

**Time to productivity**: How long does it take for a new hire to become fully effective in their role? Faster ramp-up time indicates better hiring decisions.

**Cultural fit and engagement**: Do new hires integrate into the team? Are they engaged, or are they checked out and just collecting a paycheck?

**Manager satisfaction**: Are hiring managers happy with the people you've placed, or are they constantly complaining about quality?

**Business impact**: Are new hires contributing to revenue, cost savings, or other measurable business outcomes?

[The best quality of hire frameworks combine multiple metrics rather than relying on a single number](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/trends/quality-of-hire-measurement). Performance alone doesn't tell you if someone will stay. Retention alone doesn't tell you if someone is effective. You need a holistic view.

## How Companies Are Actually Measuring This

The companies leading the charge aren't just tracking quality of hire as a feel-good metric. [They're building data infrastructure to measure it systematically](https://www.hrdive.com/news/quality-of-hire-metrics-2025/634567/).

**90-day and 180-day performance reviews**: Instead of waiting a full year, companies are checking in earlier to assess whether new hires are on track. [This allows them to identify issues faster and adjust recruiting strategies accordingly](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/quality-of-hire-early-indicators).

**Retention cohort analysis**: Tracking retention by hiring source, recruiter, interview process, and role. [If candidates sourced from LinkedIn have 85% retention after 18 months but referrals have 95% retention, that's actionable data](https://www.ere.net/quality-of-hire-retention-analysis/).

**Performance data integration**: Connecting ATS data with performance management systems to track which hires become top performers. [This reveals patterns like "candidates who did X during interviews tend to outperform" or "hires from Y source consistently underperform"](https://www.aihr.com/blog/quality-of-hire/).

**Manager feedback loops**: Systematically surveying hiring managers 90 days after a hire starts. [Simple questions like "Would you hire this person again?" and "How does this hire compare to others in similar roles?" provide qualitative insights that numbers can't capture](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/how-to-guides/measuring-quality-hire).

**Business outcome tracking**: For revenue-generating roles, tracking whether new hires hit quota. For engineering roles, measuring code quality and project delivery. [Tying hires directly to business results is the ultimate quality metric](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/quality-of-hire-measuring-what-matters).

## Why Most Companies Still Aren't Measuring Quality of Hire

If quality of hire is so important, why aren't more companies measuring it?

Because it's hard. [Measuring time-to-fill is easy—you just track the number of days from job posting to offer acceptance](https://www.ere.net/why-companies-dont-measure-quality-of-hire/). Measuring quality of hire requires integrating data from your ATS, HRIS, performance management system, and sometimes even business intelligence tools.

Most HR systems weren't built to talk to each other. Your ATS knows who you hired and where they came from. Your performance management system knows how they're performing. But connecting those two systems? That requires data infrastructure most companies don't have.

[Only 31% of companies report having a standardized quality of hire metric](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/trends/quality-of-hire-measurement). The rest either don't measure it at all or rely on informal assessments that can't be tracked systematically.

## The AI Advantage in Quality of Hire Measurement

Here's where it gets interesting: [AI-powered recruiting platforms are making quality of hire measurement dramatically easier](https://www.hiretual.com/blog/ai-quality-of-hire-prediction).

Instead of manually connecting data from multiple systems, AI platforms can:

**Predict quality of hire before making offers**: By analyzing historical data on successful hires, AI models can flag candidates who match the profile of top performers. [Some platforms claim 70%+ accuracy in predicting which candidates will succeed](https://www.eightfold.ai/blog/predictive-analytics-quality-of-hire/).

**Track quality automatically**: Once integrated with performance systems, AI platforms can monitor new hire performance, retention, and engagement without manual reporting. [This creates real-time quality of hire dashboards that update continuously](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-analytics/ai-quality-of-hire-tracking).

**Identify patterns in successful hires**: AI can surface insights like "candidates who worked at Company X tend to outperform" or "candidates with Skill Y have 90% retention vs. 70% for others." [These patterns help recruiters make better sourcing and screening decisions](https://www.pymetrics.ai/blog/quality-of-hire-ai-insights).

**Adjust sourcing strategies in real-time**: If AI detects that hires from a specific source are underperforming, it can automatically deprioritize that channel. [This creates a continuous improvement loop where recruiting gets better over time](https://www.eightfold.ai/blog/ai-recruiting-continuous-improvement).

## What This Means for Recruiters

If you're a recruiter who's been measured primarily on time-to-fill and number of hires, 2025 is the year that changes.

[Companies are shifting accountability to quality metrics](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-accountability-quality-hire-2025). You'll increasingly be evaluated on:

**Do the people you hire perform well?** If your hires consistently underperform or leave within 12 months, your sourcing or screening process needs improvement.

**Do hiring managers trust your judgment?** If managers bypass you or ignore your recommendations, you're not adding value.

**Are you improving over time?** Companies want to see learning and iteration. If your quality of hire metrics aren't improving quarter over quarter, leadership will ask why.

The recruiters who thrive in this environment are the ones who embrace data, obsess over what makes a successful hire in their organization, and continuously refine their process based on outcomes.

The recruiters who struggle are the ones who treat hiring as transactional—fill the seat, move to the next req, repeat. That approach is officially obsolete.

## How to Actually Improve Your Quality of Hire

Ready to shift from volume to quality? Here's your playbook:

**Define what "quality" means for each role**: A great engineer looks different from a great salesperson. Work with hiring managers to define success criteria specific to each function.

**Track your hires long-term**: Don't just celebrate offer acceptances. Follow up at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year to see how they're actually performing.

**Analyze your best hires**: What do your top performers have in common? Where did you source them? What interview signals indicated they'd be great? Replicate those patterns.

**Kill low-performing sources**: If Indeed postings consistently yield hires who don't last 6 months, stop wasting budget on Indeed. Shift resources to channels that produce quality.

**Improve interview processes**: [Structured interviews with standardized questions correlate strongly with quality of hire](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/structured-interviews-quality-hire). If your process is "wing it and see how it goes," tighten it up.

**Get manager feedback systematically**: Don't wait for complaints. Proactively ask hiring managers about new hire performance and use that feedback to adjust.

## The Bottom Line

[Quality of hire is no longer a nice-to-have metric—it's the metric that determines whether recruiting adds value or just fills seats](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/trends/quality-of-hire-measurement).

The companies building quality of hire frameworks in 2025 will identify better candidates, make smarter sourcing decisions, and justify their recruiting investments with data. The ones still measuring success by time-to-fill and cost-per-hire will keep hiring people who leave or underperform—and wonder why their recruiting isn't working.

Your job as a recruiter is shifting from "fill the role fast" to "hire people who succeed." That's a harder job, but it's also a more valuable one.
