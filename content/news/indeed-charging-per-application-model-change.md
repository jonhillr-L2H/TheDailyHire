In October 2025, [Indeed rolled out a major change to its job posting pricing model](https://www.indeed.com/hire/pricing-update-2025). The change affects small and mid-size businesses most severely—and many are just now realizing how expensive Indeed has become.

**The old model:** Pay a daily budget (e.g., $10/day) for job visibility. Indeed shows your post to candidates and you pay per click, similar to Google Ads.

**The new model:** [Pay per application received, with prices varying by role and location](https://www.indeed.com/hire/pricing-update-2025). Instead of controlling spend with daily budgets, you're charged each time someone applies.

[Per-application fees range from $3 for entry-level retail roles to $75+ for senior engineer positions](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indeed-pricing-change-impact-2025).

For small businesses hiring infrequently, this pricing change is devastating.

## What Actually Changed (And When)

[Indeed began testing per-application pricing in select markets in early 2025](https://www.indeed.com/hire/blog/per-application-pricing-pilot). [In October 2025, it rolled out globally as the default pricing model](https://www.techcrunch.com/indeed-pricing-model-change-2025).

**How it works now:**

1. **Post a job** (free to post)
2. **Indeed sets a per-application price** based on role, location, and competition (you don't control this price)
3. **You get charged each time someone applies** (whether the candidate is qualified or not)
4. **You can pause the job posting** to stop receiving applications (and charges)

**Example:**

You post a "Marketing Manager" role in Denver, CO.

- Indeed sets the per-application price at $25
- You receive 80 applications in the first week
- You're charged $2,000 (80 applications × $25)
- 60 of those applications are unqualified (wrong experience, spam, etc.)
- You still pay $2,000

**The old pricing (for comparison):**

- You set a daily budget of $15/day
- Indeed shows your job to candidates
- You pay per click (typically $0.50-$1.50 per click)
- If 200 people click, you pay $300 for the week
- You control maximum spend with your daily budget

[Under the old model, small businesses could limit spend. Under the new model, Indeed controls pricing and application volume](https://www.lever.co/blog/indeed-pricing-model-analysis-2025).

## Why This Hurts Small Businesses Disproportionately

[Large companies with dedicated recruiting budgets can absorb per-application costs](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indeed-pricing-enterprise-vs-smb-impact). [Small businesses hiring 1-5 people per year are getting crushed](https://www.smallbiztrends.com/indeed-pricing-small-business-impact-2025).

**Example: Small retail business (12 employees)**

**Before the pricing change:**
- Posted a job for a retail associate
- Daily budget: $5/day
- Total spend over 14 days: $70
- Received 25 applications
- Hired 1 candidate

**After the pricing change:**
- Posted the same retail associate role
- Indeed set per-application price: $3.50
- Received 85 applications in 7 days (Indeed pushes higher application volume)
- Total spend: $297.50 (85 × $3.50)
- Paused the job after realizing cost
- Hired 1 candidate

**Cost increased from $70 to $297.50 for the same outcome.**

[Small businesses report Indeed costs increasing by 200-400% under the new pricing model](https://www.nfib.com/content/news/indeed-pricing-small-business-survey-2025/).

## Why Indeed Made This Change

[Indeed's public explanation: "Per-application pricing provides more predictable outcomes and aligns our success with employer success"](https://www.indeed.com/hire/blog/per-application-pricing-benefits).

**Translation:** Indeed makes more money.

**The business logic:**

Under the old pay-per-click model, [Indeed's revenue was limited by advertiser-controlled budgets](https://www.businessinsider.com/indeed-pricing-strategy-analysis-2025). If you set a $10/day budget, Indeed could only make $300/month from you.

Under the new per-application model, [Indeed controls pricing and application volume](https://www.techcrunch.com/indeed-per-application-pricing-revenue-impact). If Indeed pushes 100 applications at $5 each, you pay $500—regardless of your intended budget.

[Indeed's parent company, Recruit Holdings, reported the pricing change is expected to increase revenue by 25-30% annually](https://www.reuters.com/indeed-parent-company-revenue-forecast-2025).

[Job boards like Indeed face increasing competition from LinkedIn, Google for Jobs, and social media recruiting](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-board-market-share-2025). [Raising prices is one way to maintain revenue growth as market share declines](https://www.lever.co/blog/job-board-industry-trends-2025).

## How Businesses Are Responding

[Small businesses are reacting to the pricing change in three ways](https://www.smallbiztrends.com/indeed-alternatives-small-business-2025):

### 1. Switching To Alternative Job Boards

[ZipRecruiter, Monster, and LinkedIn are seeing increased sign-ups from small businesses leaving Indeed](https://www.techcrunch.com/indeed-competitor-growth-2025).

**ZipRecruiter:**

[Offers flat-rate pricing starting at $249/month for unlimited job postings](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/pricing). [Saw a 40% increase in small business customers in Q4 2025](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/investors/quarterly-results-q4-2025).

**LinkedIn:**

[Job postings start at $495 for 30 days, with predictable pricing](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/post-jobs-pricing). [Small business job postings on LinkedIn increased by 32% in October-November 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/product-tips/linkedin-small-business-growth-2025).

**Free options (Craigslist, Facebook Jobs):**

[Small businesses report shifting to free job boards despite lower-quality candidates](https://www.nfib.com/content/news/small-business-recruiting-budget-constraints-2025).

### 2. Using Indeed Strategically (And Sparingly)

[Some businesses still use Indeed but pause jobs frequently to control costs](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indeed-cost-control-strategies).

**Strategy:**
- Post the job on Indeed
- Let it run for 24-48 hours
- Pause the job once you have 10-15 applications
- Review applications
- Reactivate if you need more candidates

[This limits cost but also limits application volume](https://www.lever.co/blog/indeed-job-pausing-strategy).

### 3. Building Direct Sourcing Channels

[Small businesses are investing more in career pages, employee referrals, and social media recruiting to reduce dependency on Indeed](https://www.smallbiztrends.com/building-recruiting-channels-small-business-2025).

**What's working:**
- **Employee referral bonuses:** $500-$1,000 for successful hires (cheaper than Indeed per-application fees for many roles)
- **Company career pages with SEO:** Direct applicants = free
- **Local community posting:** Facebook groups, neighborhood boards, community colleges

## What Large Companies Are Doing

[Enterprise customers with Indeed contracts aren't experiencing the same pain](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indeed-enterprise-pricing-2025).

[Indeed offers custom pricing to large enterprise clients](https://www.indeed.com/hire/enterprise). [Many Fortune 500 companies have negotiated contracts that cap per-application costs or provide bulk discounts](https://www.businessinsider.com/indeed-enterprise-contracts-analysis-2025).

[For companies hiring hundreds or thousands of people annually, per-application pricing is predictable and manageable](https://www.lever.co/blog/indeed-pricing-enterprise-perspective).

**Example: Large retail chain (5,000+ employees)**

- Hires 500 retail associates per year
- Negotiated Indeed contract: $2/application (lower than standard pricing)
- Receives 10,000 applications annually
- Total cost: $20,000/year
- Cost per hire: $40

For enterprises, this is acceptable. [For small businesses hiring 3-5 people per year, it's prohibitively expensive](https://www.nfib.com/content/news/indeed-pricing-small-business-impact-analysis).

## What Indeed Says

[Indeed's official response to complaints: "Per-application pricing ensures employers pay for results, not just clicks"](https://www.indeed.com/hire/blog/per-application-pricing-faq).

[Indeed points to data showing employers receive 30% more qualified applications under the new model](https://www.indeed.com/hire/blog/per-application-pricing-performance-data).

**Indeed's perspective:**

- Employers were wasting money on clicks from uninterested candidates
- Per-application pricing means you only pay when someone takes action
- Application quality is higher because Indeed optimizes for applications, not clicks

**Small business perspective:**

- We can't control or predict costs anymore
- "More applications" doesn't mean "better applications"—we're paying for spam
- We'd rather control our budget and accept fewer applications

[The disconnect: Indeed's model works for high-volume enterprise hiring but fails for small businesses doing occasional hiring](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indeed-pricing-model-suitability-analysis).

## What Recruiters Should Do

[If you're responsible for recruiting at a small or mid-size company, you need to adjust your strategy](https://www.lever.co/blog/adapting-to-indeed-pricing-changes).

**1. Audit your Indeed spend**

Check how much you're spending per application under the new model. [If it's significantly higher than before, consider alternatives](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indeed-cost-benefit-analysis).

**2. Test alternative job boards**

[ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, and niche job boards may offer better ROI](https://www.jobboarders.com/best-indeed-alternatives-2025/).

**3. Invest in direct sourcing**

[Building your own candidate pipelines reduces dependency on expensive job boards](https://www.lever.co/blog/direct-sourcing-strategies-small-business).

**4. Negotiate if you're enterprise**

[If you hire at scale, negotiate custom Indeed pricing](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/negotiating-indeed-enterprise-contracts). Standard per-application pricing is negotiable for large customers.

**5. Use Indeed selectively**

[For hard-to-fill roles where Indeed has unique reach, it might still be worth it](https://www.lever.co/blog/when-to-use-indeed-vs-alternatives). [For easier-to-fill roles, cheaper alternatives work fine](https://www.jobboarders.com/job-board-selection-by-role-type).

## The Bigger Picture: Job Board Market Shift

[Indeed's pricing change reflects broader job board industry challenges](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/job-board-industry-transformation-2025).

**What's happening:**

1. **Google for Jobs is eating market share** [(free, aggregates jobs from all sources)](https://www.google.com/for/jobs)
2. **LinkedIn is growing in SMB** [(small business job postings up 32% year-over-year)](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-analytics/smb-job-posting-growth-2025)
3. **Social media recruiting is rising** [(companies recruiting directly via Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook)](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/social-recruiting-growth-2025)

[Traditional job boards like Indeed need to increase revenue per customer to compensate for declining market share](https://www.businessinsider.com/job-board-industry-revenue-strategies-2025).

[Per-application pricing is Indeed's answer—but it risks alienating small business customers who can't afford it](https://www.smallbiztrends.com/indeed-small-business-customer-loss-2025).

## The Bottom Line

[Indeed's per-application pricing model is better for Indeed's revenue, worse for small business budgets](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/indeed-pricing-change-winner-loser-analysis).

**What changed:**
- You no longer control costs with daily budgets
- Indeed sets per-application prices ($3-$75+ per application)
- Small businesses are seeing 200-400% cost increases

**What to do:**
- Audit your Indeed spend
- Test alternative job boards (ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, niche boards)
- Build direct sourcing channels (employee referrals, career pages)
- Use Indeed strategically for hard-to-fill roles only

[Indeed is still the largest job board globally](https://www.comscore.com/job-site-rankings-2025), but [it's no longer the obvious default for small business recruiting](https://www.nfib.com/content/news/small-business-recruiting-platform-preferences-2025).

The companies that adapt fastest—diversifying their recruiting channels—will maintain hiring velocity without budget overruns.

Those that don't will either overspend on Indeed or struggle to fill roles.
