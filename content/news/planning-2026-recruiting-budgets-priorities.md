Every November, recruiters face the same challenge: plan next year's recruiting budget while leadership says "hire more people" and finance says "with less money."

[68% of recruiting leaders report being asked to increase hiring targets for 2026 while keeping budgets flat or reducing them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/2026-recruiting-budget-survey).

[The average company recruiting budget for 2026 is projected to be $4,200 per hire—down 8% from 2025](https://www.lever.co/blog/2026-recruiting-budget-benchmarks).

Meanwhile, [job boards are raising prices](https://www.indeed.com/hire/pricing-update-2025), [candidate expectations are higher](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/candidate-expectations-2025), and [time-to-fill keeps increasing](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/time-to-fill-trends-2025).

Here's how to build a 2026 recruiting budget that's realistic, defensible, and doesn't set you up for failure.

## Start With 2025 Actuals (Not What You Budgeted)

**Don't use your 2025 budget as a baseline. Use what you actually spent.**

[Most recruiting budgets are wrong because they're based on what was planned, not what was real](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiting-budget-planning-mistakes).

**Pull these numbers from 2025:**

✅ **Total hires made** (not planned hires—actual hires)

✅ **Total recruiting spend** (job boards, agencies, tools, events, swag, everything)

✅ **Cost-per-hire by channel:**
- Direct applications (career site)
- Job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Agency/search firm placements
- Employee referrals
- Campus recruiting
- Other sources

✅ **Cost-per-hire by role type:**
- Executive
- Professional/salaried
- Hourly/frontline

✅ **Time-to-fill by role type**

✅ **Offer acceptance rate**

✅ **90-day retention rate**

[Having real 2025 data makes your 2026 budget defensible](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/data-driven-recruiting-budgets). You're not guessing—you're projecting based on evidence.

## Calculate Your True Cost-Per-Hire

Most companies under-calculate cost-per-hire because they forget hidden costs.

**Standard cost-per-hire calculation:**

(External costs + Internal costs) ÷ Number of hires

**External costs:**
- Job board subscriptions (Indeed, LinkedIn, niche boards)
- Agency/search firm fees
- Background checks
- Skills assessments
- Recruitment marketing (ads, events, swag)
- Candidate travel/relocation

**Internal costs (often forgotten):**
- Recruiter salaries (allocated by time spent recruiting)
- ATS/recruiting software licenses
- Interviewer time (hiring managers, team members)
- Onboarding costs
- Recruiting operations support

[The national average cost-per-hire in 2025 is $4,700](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cost-per-hire-benchmarks-2025). [Tech companies average $7,500. Entry-level hourly roles average $1,800](https://www.lever.co/blog/cost-per-hire-by-industry-2025).

**If your 2025 cost-per-hire was higher than average, expect finance to ask why.**

Be ready to explain:
- Competitive markets (hard-to-fill roles cost more)
- Quality-of-hire (higher cost but better retention)
- Agency reliance (and plans to reduce it)

## Build Bottom-Up, Not Top-Down

**Bad approach:** "Finance allocated $X for recruiting. Let's figure out how to spend it."

**Good approach:** "We need to make Y hires. Here's what it will realistically cost."

**Bottom-up budget calculation:**

**Step 1: Determine 2026 hiring targets by role type**

Example:
- 10 executives
- 40 professional/salaried employees
- 100 hourly/frontline employees

**Step 2: Calculate expected cost-per-hire by role type (based on 2025 actuals)**

Example:
- Executives: $15,000 per hire (agency fees, extensive search)
- Professional: $5,000 per hire (job boards, some agency use)
- Hourly: $1,500 per hire (job boards, referrals)

**Step 3: Calculate total recruiting spend needed**

- 10 executives × $15,000 = $150,000
- 40 professional × $5,000 = $200,000
- 100 hourly × $1,500 = $150,000
- **Total: $500,000**

**Step 4: Add 10-15% buffer for:**
- Unplanned hiring (backfills, unexpected growth)
- Market changes (if costs increase)
- Failed searches (some roles take multiple attempts)

**Total budget request: $550,000-$575,000**

[Bottom-up budgets are defensible because they're based on real hiring needs and historical data](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/bottom-up-recruiting-budgets).

## What To Do When Leadership Says "That's Too Much"

**Finance will push back. They always do.**

[78% of recruiting leaders report their initial budget requests being cut by 15-30%](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiting-budget-negotiation-2025).

**How to respond:**

**Option 1: Show the trade-offs**

"If we reduce the budget to $400,000, we can afford to hire:
- 8 executives (instead of 10)
- 30 professional employees (instead of 40)
- 100 hourly employees (unchanged)

Which roles should we deprioritize?"

[Forcing leadership to make explicit trade-offs prevents unrealistic expectations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-budget-negotiation-strategies).

**Option 2: Show cost of NOT hiring**

"Each month we leave the Senior Engineer role open costs us $X in lost productivity / delayed projects / revenue impact."

[Quantifying the cost of open roles helps justify recruiting investment](https://www.lever.co/blog/cost-of-unfilled-roles-analysis).

**Option 3: Propose efficiency improvements**

"If we invest $50K in [referral program/sourcing tools/process improvements], we can reduce agency spend by $150K and still hit targets."

[Showing how you'll reduce costs in one area to invest in another makes you look strategic, not defensive](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-efficiency-investments).

## Where To Invest in 2026 (Based on Current Trends)

[SHRM surveyed 1,200+ recruiting leaders about 2026 budget priorities](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/2026-recruiting-budget-survey). Here's where they're investing:

**#1 Priority: Employee referral programs (63% increasing investment)**

**Why:** [Referrals have the lowest cost-per-hire ($1,200 average) and highest retention rates](https://www.lever.co/blog/employee-referral-roi-2025).

**How to invest:**
- Increase referral bonuses ($1,000-$2,000 per hire)
- Add gamification/contests
- Make referral process stupidly easy

**ROI:** Every $1 spent on referral programs saves $3-5 on job boards and agencies.

**#2 Priority: Recruiting automation and AI tools (57% increasing investment)**

**Why:** [Automation reduces time-to-hire by 30-40% and allows recruiters to handle more reqs](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiting-automation-roi).

**Where to invest:**
- Resume screening AI
- Interview scheduling automation
- Candidate engagement tools
- Sourcing automation

**ROI:** One recruiter with good automation can handle 30-40 reqs instead of 20-25.

**#3 Priority: Employer branding and candidate experience (51% increasing investment)**

**Why:** [Strong employer brand reduces cost-per-hire by 50% and increases application rates by 2-3x](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/employer-brand-roi-2025).

**Where to invest:**
- Career site improvements
- Employee storytelling content
- Glassdoor/Indeed review management
- Candidate communication tools

**ROI:** Better employer brand means more direct applications (cheap) and fewer job board dollars needed.

**What's DECREASING in 2026 budgets:**

❌ **Job board spend** (52% reducing) - [Costs rising, quality declining](https://www.indeed.com/hire/pricing-update-2025)

❌ **Agency/search firm reliance** (48% reducing) - [Too expensive, trying to build internal sourcing](https://www.lever.co/blog/reducing-agency-dependence)

❌ **Campus recruiting** (31% reducing) - [ROI unclear, entry-level remote work reduces need](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/campus-recruiting-roi-2025)

## How To Allocate Budget Across Channels

**Based on 2025 industry benchmarks**, here's typical budget allocation:

**Job boards: 25-35%**
- Indeed, LinkedIn, niche boards
- Budget for both organic and sponsored posts

**Agencies/search firms: 15-25%**
- Focus on executive and hard-to-fill roles only
- Negotiate volume discounts if using regularly

**Employee referrals: 10-15%**
- Referral bonuses
- Referral program management tools
- Contests and incentives

**Recruiting tools/software: 10-15%**
- ATS subscription
- Sourcing tools
- Assessment platforms
- Scheduling and automation tools

**Employer branding: 10-15%**
- Career site development
- Content creation (videos, employee stories)
- Events and recruitment marketing

**Background checks/assessments: 5-10%**
- Background verification
- Drug testing (if required)
- Skills assessments

**Other: 10-15%**
- Candidate travel/relocation
- Swag and candidate experience
- Conference/event sponsorships
- Recruiting team training

[Your allocation will vary based on industry, role types, and hiring volume](https://www.lever.co/blog/recruiting-budget-allocation-best-practices).

## Metrics To Track in 2026 (To Prove ROI)

**Finance will ask: "Did recruiting deliver value in 2026?"**

Track these metrics to prove it:

✅ **Cost-per-hire** (vs. budget and vs. 2025)

✅ **Time-to-fill** (vs. 2025)

✅ **Quality-of-hire** (90-day retention, performance ratings, manager satisfaction)

✅ **Source effectiveness** (which channels deliver best candidates at lowest cost)

✅ **Offer acceptance rate** (higher = better candidate experience and comp strategy)

✅ **Hiring velocity** (are you filling roles faster year-over-year?)

[Track monthly, report quarterly, and tie metrics to business outcomes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-metrics-that-matter-2026).

**Example narrative:**

"In 2026, we reduced cost-per-hire by 12% while improving 90-day retention by 8%. Our investment in employee referral programs generated 40% of hires at half the cost of job boards. Time-to-fill decreased by 15 days, allowing us to fill critical roles faster."

## The Bottom Line

**2026 recruiting budgets will be tight.** Companies want to hire more with less money.

**How to build a defensible budget:**

1. **Start with 2025 actuals** (not what you planned, what actually happened)
2. **Calculate true cost-per-hire** (including hidden costs)
3. **Build bottom-up** (hiring needs × realistic costs)
4. **Show trade-offs** (if you cut budget, which roles don't get filled?)
5. **Invest strategically** (referrals, automation, employer brand)
6. **Track ROI** (prove recruiting delivers value)

[The companies that get adequate recruiting budgets in 2026 will be those that prove ROI in 2025](https://www.lever.co/blog/2026-recruiting-budget-best-practices).
