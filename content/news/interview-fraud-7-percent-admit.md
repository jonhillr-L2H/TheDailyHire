Here's a stat that should make every recruiter sweat: [7% of candidates admit to completing an interview while pretending to be someone else](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025). Not "embellishing their resume." Not "exaggerating their experience." Literally having another person take the interview for them.

And before you say "that would never happen at my company," remember that these are just the people willing to admit it in a survey. The actual number? Probably higher.

[Remote interviews made this problem exponentially worse](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025), and most companies' verification processes aren't catching it until day one—or sometimes not until weeks into employment when the person clearly can't do the job they interviewed for.

Let's talk about why this is happening and what you actually need to do about it.

## How Interview Fraud Actually Works

The most common scenario: A candidate applies for a technical role they're not qualified for. They have a friend or someone they hire take the technical interview. The proxy performs well, the company extends an offer, and the actual candidate shows up on day one unable to do the work.

[With remote interviews becoming standard, it's easier than ever to have someone else off-camera coaching you through answers or even taking the entire interview](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends). Some candidates use:

- Someone else physically present off-camera feeding them answers
- Wireless earpieces with a remote coach providing responses
- Pre-recorded video interviews where someone else takes the entire thing
- Screen-sharing setups where the proxy controls the candidate's screen during technical assessments

The incentive? [With AI skills in high demand and companies offering six-figure salaries for technical roles, the motivation to fraudulently land these positions is significant](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html).

## Why Companies Aren't Catching This

Most companies rely on resume verification and background checks. Problem: [those processes verify employment history and education, not whether the person who interviewed is the same person who showed up](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025).

Traditional verification processes include:
- Background checks (verify criminal history, employment dates, education)
- Reference checks (verify performance at previous companies)
- Employment verification (confirm dates and titles)

None of these verify that the candidate who aced your technical interview is the same person accepting your offer.

[Only 38% of companies have processes to verify candidate identity during virtual interviews](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025), which means 62% are operating on trust alone.

## The Red Flags You're Probably Missing

Here are signals that fraud might be happening—signals that recruiters and hiring managers often miss:

**Significant performance drop between interview rounds:** Candidate nails the technical screen but struggles in the behavioral interview. Could be nerves. Could also be different people.

**Camera is always off or positioned strangely:** Claims technical issues but never fixes them across multiple interviews.

**Responses sound scripted or delayed:** Long pauses before answering questions, or answers that sound like they're being read.

**Different communication style between written and verbal:** Their emails are polished and technical, but verbal communication is poor. Or vice versa.

**Day one performance doesn't match interview performance:** They can't demonstrate basic skills they showcased in the interview.

[These aren't definitive proof, but they should trigger additional verification steps](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends).

## What Actually Works to Prevent Interview Fraud

**Identity Verification Tools:** [Platforms that verify candidate identity using government-issued IDs and biometric matching are becoming essential for remote interviews](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html). These tools confirm the person on camera matches the ID they provided.

**Live Technical Assessments:** Pre-recorded coding challenges can be outsourced. Live pair programming or whiteboarding sessions where you watch the candidate work in real-time are harder to fake.

**Camera-On Requirements:** Make camera participation mandatory for all interview rounds. If someone can't or won't turn their camera on across multiple interviews, that's a red flag worth investigating.

**Consistent Communication:** Interview the same person across multiple rounds and formats. Phone screen, video technical interview, panel behavioral interview. Consistency in communication style and knowledge across formats is a good signal.

**Skills Validation on Day One:** [Implement brief technical validations during onboarding](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025). Quick assessments that confirm the new hire can do what they claimed in the interview. Not exhaustive testing—just basic confirmation.

## The Uncomfortable Economics of This Problem

Here's why interview fraud is increasing: [The payoff is massive and the risk is relatively low](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025).

If a candidate can fraudulently land a $150K engineering role and last even six months before being caught, they've made $75K. Even if they're fired and have to find a new job, many aren't facing criminal charges—just termination.

[Companies are often reluctant to publicly acknowledge they've been scammed because it reflects poorly on their hiring process](https://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/feature/7-talent-acquisition-and-recruitment-trends). So they quietly fire the person and move on, which means there's no industry-wide awareness of repeat offenders.

[Recruiting fraud detection software and identity verification platforms are seeing massive growth](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html) precisely because this problem is becoming more common, not less.

## This Isn't Just a Technical Hiring Problem

While technical roles are the most common targets (because of high salaries and the ability to obscure skills gaps during remote interviews), [fraud is happening across roles](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025):

- **Sales roles:** Someone with strong interview skills coaches a friend through the process
- **Executive positions:** Consultants helping executives land roles by feeding them answers
- **Customer service roles:** High-volume hiring with minimal verification creates opportunities

Any role that's primarily interviewed remotely and doesn't have rigorous identity verification is vulnerable.

## What You Need to Do Right Now

If you're conducting remote interviews and don't have identity verification processes, you're exposed. Here's your action plan:

**Implement basic identity verification:** At minimum, require candidates to show government-issued ID on camera before technical interviews begin. Not bulletproof, but better than nothing.

**Make cameras mandatory:** No exceptions. If someone can't participate with video across multiple rounds, they're not a viable candidate for a remote role.

**Conduct live assessments:** Stop relying entirely on take-home coding challenges or pre-recorded interviews. Live interactions are harder to fake.

**Watch for red flags:** Train interviewers to notice inconsistencies in communication style, knowledge level, and behavior across interview rounds.

**Validate skills early in onboarding:** Quick skills checks during the first week confirm you hired who you think you hired.

**Consider fraud detection tools:** [If you're hiring high-volume technical roles, identity verification platforms are worth the investment](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/blogs/human-capital/ai-in-talent-acquisition.html).

## The Bottom Line

[7% of candidates admitting to interview fraud means this isn't an edge case—it's a real risk that requires process changes](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/featured-topics/talent-recruitment/talent-acquisition-trends-2025). Remote interviews aren't going away, which means verification can't be optional anymore.

The companies that adapt their hiring processes to include identity verification and live skills validation will make better hires. The ones that operate on trust alone will keep getting burned by candidates who aren't who they claim to be.

Your background checks verify employment history. But they don't verify the person you interviewed is the person who's showing up to work. Fix that gap before it costs you a bad hire—or worse, a team that loses trust in your vetting process.

[Verifying a candidate's identity and credentials is now a critical priority for talent acquisition teams](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/express-requests/talent-acquisition-trends-for-2025). Not because everyone is dishonest, but because enough people are that ignoring this problem isn't a viable strategy anymore.
