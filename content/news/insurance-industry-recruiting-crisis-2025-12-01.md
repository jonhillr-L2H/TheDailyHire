# Insurance Industry's Talent Crisis: Adjusters and Underwriters Are Jumping Ship Fast

While tech layoffs grab headlines, there's a quiet talent exodus happening in insurance that's creating serious opportunity for recruiters who know where to look. [The Jacobson Group's 2025 Insurance Labor Market Study](https://www.jacobsononline.com/) reports 34% of insurance professionals are actively seeking new jobs - the highest rate in 15 years - with claims adjusters and underwriters leading the departure.

## The Great Insurance Resignation Nobody Saw Coming

The numbers are ugly. According to [Bureau of Labor Statistics data](https://www.bls.gov/), the insurance industry lost 78,000 workers in 2024, with turnover rates for claims adjusters hitting 23% (nearly double the industry average five years ago). Underwriters aren't far behind at 19% turnover.

What's driving people out? It's not just salary, though [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/) shows insurance professionals earn 15-20% less than comparable roles in finance or tech. The real killer is combination of increased workload from climate-related claims, outdated technology systems that make jobs unnecessarily painful, and a complete lack of career progression. [Insurance Journal surveys](https://www.insurancejournal.com/) found 61% of adjusters say their case loads have doubled since 2020 with no additional compensation.

## Climate Change Is Breaking The Adjuster Market

Here's the part nobody wants to say out loud: Climate change is making insurance jobs absolutely brutal, and companies aren't adjusting (pun intended) their hiring or retention strategies. The [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/) reports catastrophic weather events increased 340% since 2000, which means adjusters are handling unprecedented claim volumes while dealing with increasingly hostile customers whose premiums keep rising.

Field adjusters are getting physically and emotionally burned out. Hurricane seasons now stretch longer, wildfire seasons are year-round in some states, and flooding happens in places that "never flood." Meanwhile, insurance companies are responding by... adding more metrics and AI oversight tools that make adjusters feel like assembly line workers rather than trusted professionals.

## The Opportunity For Recruiters Is Massive

If you're recruiting for insurance companies, good luck - you're fighting retention wars with one hand tied behind your back. But if you're recruiting FOR these departing professionals? Welcome to easy mode.

Experienced adjusters and underwriters have immediately transferable skills. [Risk management, data analysis, customer service, claims investigation](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Insurance/Salary) - these map directly to corporate roles in risk management, vendor management, contract analysis, and customer success. According to [ZipRecruiter data](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/), former insurance adjusters transitioning to corporate roles see average salary increases of 28%.

The play is simple: Identify insurance professionals on LinkedIn who've been at their companies 5+ years (they're loyal but probably exhausted), highlight roles with better work-life balance and modern tech stacks, and emphasize career growth opportunities. These candidates aren't flooding the market with applications - they're passive but very moveable with the right approach.

Insurance companies are trying to solve this with signing bonuses and licensing reimbursement, but you can't bonus your way out of a workload crisis. Until the industry fundamentally changes how it treats these roles, the talent drain continues - and smart recruiters are there to catch them.
