The retail seasonal hiring surge that defined the last few years is done. [The National Retail Federation forecasts retailers will hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers in 2025, down from 442,000 last year](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). That's a 40% decline at the high end, and it signals a major shift in retail recruiting.

[For recruiters in retail, the 2025 seasonal hiring period is calmer and more cost-efficient than recent years](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). But "calmer" is corporate-speak for "way less demand." The competitive frenzy for seasonal workers is over, replaced by something much more measured.

This isn't just a seasonal blip. It's a fundamental change in how retail operates during the holidays, and it has implications beyond just seasonal staffing.

## Why Retail Seasonal Hiring Collapsed

**Slower consumer spending:** [With hiring demand cooled across the retail industry](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/), retailers aren't preparing for the explosive sales volumes that drove massive seasonal hiring in 2021-2023. Consumer spending hasn't crashed, but the growth rate has slowed significantly.

When consumers aren't buying as aggressively, retailers don't need as many workers to handle transactions, stock shelves, and manage fulfillment. It's simple supply and demand—less customer demand means less labor demand.

**Lower worker turnover:** [Fewer job openings and lower worker turnover](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/) mean retailers have more stable core workforces heading into the holidays. When full-time employees aren't quitting at high rates, there's less need to backfill with seasonal workers.

The Great Resignation drove turnover rates through the roof in 2021-2022, forcing retailers to hire massive seasonal workforces. In 2025, turnover has normalized, and the desperate staffing shortages are gone.

**Efficiency improvements:** Retailers have invested heavily in automation, self-checkout technology, curbside pickup systems, and streamlined fulfillment processes. [These efficiency gains reduce the number of workers needed to handle similar sales volumes](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

A retailer that needed 100 seasonal workers in 2022 might only need 60 in 2025 because technology is handling tasks that previously required human labor.

## The Numbers in Context

Even with the decline, [265,000-365,000 seasonal positions is still substantial](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). Retail hiring isn't dead—it's just returning to pre-pandemic norms. The 2021-2023 period was the outlier, driven by pandemic-related disruptions, massive government stimulus, and supply chain chaos.

But the decline is significant enough that recruiters who built strategies around hyper-competitive seasonal hiring markets need to recalibrate. [The days of offering signing bonuses, same-day interviews, and aggressive perks just to secure seasonal workers are largely over](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

For context, retail hired around 700,000 seasonal workers during peak pandemic years. Going from 700K to 300K is a massive market contraction. Recruiting strategies that worked in 2022 don't work in 2025 because the entire labor market dynamic has shifted.

## What This Means for Retail Recruiters

**Less urgency, more selectivity:** [Retailers can be more selective about seasonal hires rather than taking anyone with a pulse](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). When you're desperate to fill 500 positions in three weeks, quality standards drop. When you're filling 200 positions over six weeks, you can actually evaluate candidates properly.

This is good for hiring quality, but it also means candidates face stiffer competition. The "anyone can get a seasonal retail job" assumption no longer holds.

**Lower wages and fewer perks:** The competitive wage pressure that drove retail wages up 15-20% during the pandemic is easing. [Retailers don't need to offer premium pay to attract sufficient applicants](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

Signing bonuses, flexible scheduling, and aggressive benefits packages were necessary when labor supply was tight. Now that labor supply has loosened, retailers are cutting back on those expensive recruitment incentives.

**Longer recruiting timelines:** [Without the urgency of immediate staffing crises, retail recruiters can take more time to source, screen, and onboard seasonal workers](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). This reduces recruiting stress but also means candidates should apply earlier—waiting until mid-December to apply for seasonal work might be too late.

**Focus on retention over acquisition:** With smaller seasonal hiring needs, [retailers are investing more in retaining existing employees through the holidays rather than churning through massive seasonal workforces](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). Offering overtime to current staff is often cheaper and more effective than hiring, training, and managing temporary workers.

## The Candidate Experience Shift

For job seekers, this is a significantly different market than 2021-2023. Seasonal retail jobs are still available, but [the "guaranteed hire if you show up" dynamic is gone](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

[Applications for seasonal positions jumped 27% compared to last December](https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/10/16/job-seeker-interest-in-holiday-jobs-surges/), even as job openings declined. That means competition for seasonal work has intensified significantly. More applicants chasing fewer positions creates a buyer's market for employers.

Candidates need to apply earlier, present stronger applications, and be prepared for actual screening processes rather than same-day offers. The "walk in, get hired, start tomorrow" era of retail seasonal hiring is over.

## Regional Variations Matter

This isn't uniform across all retail markets. [High-traffic urban areas with strong consumer spending are still hiring aggressively](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). Major metro areas like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago still have robust seasonal demand.

[Smaller markets and regions with weaker consumer spending are seeing more significant hiring declines](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). A mall in a mid-sized Midwest city might hire 30 seasonal workers this year compared to 75 in 2022.

Online-focused retailers like Amazon are less affected because their fulfillment models scale differently. [Amazon still needs massive seasonal workforces to handle shipping volumes](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/), even if brick-and-mortar retail is pulling back.

## What Happens to Displaced Seasonal Workers

The 100,000+ seasonal positions that disappeared this year represent income that won't materialize for workers who relied on holiday retail jobs. [For college students, retirees supplementing fixed incomes, and people working multiple jobs, the reduction in seasonal opportunities creates financial strain](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

Some of these workers are shifting to other seasonal industries. [Shipping and logistics companies like UPS and FedEx still need substantial seasonal workforces](https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/10/16/job-seeker-interest-in-holiday-jobs-surges/). [Hospitality and food service see seasonal demand](https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/10/16/job-seeker-interest-in-holiday-jobs-surges/) as holiday travel and dining pick up.

But those industries combined don't fully absorb the workers who would have been hired in retail. That leaves a meaningful number of people who expected seasonal work not finding it.

## The Broader Economic Signal

Retail seasonal hiring is often viewed as an economic indicator. [When retailers are confident about consumer spending, they hire aggressively](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). [When they're cautious, they minimize seasonal staffing](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

A 40% decline in seasonal hiring suggests [retailers are not expecting a strong holiday sales season](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). That's concerning if you're looking at broader economic health. Consumer spending drives the U.S. economy, and cautious retail hiring implies expectations of softer spending.

This aligns with broader economic data showing slower job growth, cooling inflation, and more measured consumer behavior. [The economy isn't crashing, but it's definitely not booming](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

## What Recruiters Outside Retail Should Know

The retail seasonal hiring decline isn't isolated to retail. It reflects broader trends affecting all industries: [lower turnover, efficiency gains from technology, and more cautious hiring approaches](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

If you're recruiting in other sectors, expect similar dynamics. [The frantic labor shortages of 2021-2023 are over](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/). [Employers have more leverage, candidates face stiffer competition, and the urgency to hire immediately has decreased](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

That doesn't mean hiring has stopped—[43% of employers plan to hire in Q1 2026](https://cpgincorporated.com/december-hiring/)—but the market conditions are fundamentally different than they were two years ago.

## The Bottom Line

[Retail seasonal hiring down 40% to 265,000-365,000 workers from 442,000 last year](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/) marks the end of pandemic-era labor dynamics. [The market is calmer, more cost-efficient, and less competitive](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/)—which is good for retailers but challenging for workers who relied on seasonal opportunities.

For recruiters, this is a return to normalcy. The strategies that worked in 2019 are relevant again. [Aggressive hiring incentives, same-day offers, and desperate sourcing tactics aren't necessary anymore](https://recruitonomics.com/retail-seasonal-hiring-update-a-cooler-winter-for-recruiters/).

The question is whether this is the new baseline or if we'll see another surge in seasonal hiring if economic conditions improve. Right now, all signs point to this being the new normal: retail seasonal hiring will remain substantially lower than pandemic peaks for the foreseeable future.

That changes recruiting strategies, candidate expectations, and labor market dynamics in ways that extend well beyond just the holiday season.
