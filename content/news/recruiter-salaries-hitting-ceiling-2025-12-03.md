Remember 2021-2023 when recruiters were getting hired with six-figure base salaries and unlimited commission potential? Yeah, those days are over. The recruiting compensation party has officially ended, and a lot of people are nursing hangovers.

## The Boom Years Are Done

According to [Hirewell's 2025 Recruiter Compensation Survey](https://hirewell.com/), the median base salary for corporate recruiters increased just 2.1% in 2025—barely keeping pace with inflation. That's down from 12.3% growth in 2023 and 18.7% in 2022. Agency recruiters saw commission rates drop an average of 15% as companies squeezed margins, per [Hunt Scanlon Media](https://huntscanlon.com/).

[Glassdoor data](https://www.glassdoor.com/) shows that corporate recruiter salaries have essentially flatlined. The average base is hovering around $68,000, with total compensation (including bonuses) hitting a ceiling at around $85,000. Senior recruiters are topping out at $95,000-110,000 unless they move into leadership or specialized technical recruiting.

## Why the Market Corrected

Simple: supply and demand finally caught up. During the Great Resignation, everyone and their cousin became a recruiter because companies were desperate. [LinkedIn Economic Graph](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/linkedin-economic-graph) reports that the number of people with "Recruiter" in their title increased 47% between 2020 and 2023.

Now we've got way more recruiters competing for fewer open positions. [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) shows job openings declined 23% from their 2022 peak, while the recruiter population hasn't shrunk proportionally. It's Econ 101: when you flood the market with supply, prices (salaries) go down.

## The Commission Crunch Is Real

Agency recruiters are feeling the pain even more. [Bullhorn's 2025 Industry Trends Report](https://www.bullhorn.com/resources/) found that average placements per recruiter dropped from 14.2 in 2023 to 9.8 in 2025. When you're making fewer placements and commission rates are down, your paycheck takes a double hit.

Some agencies are trying to retain talent by adding base salary, but that just squeezes margins further. One agency owner told [Recruiting Daily](https://recruitingdaily.com/) they're stuck between paying recruiters enough to stay and making enough profit to keep the lights on. Several smaller agencies have shut down or consolidated in 2025 according to [Staffing Industry Analysts](https://www2.staffingindustry.com/).

## Where the Money Still Is

Not all recruiting roles are created equal. [Dice's Tech Recruiting Salary Report](https://www.dice.com/) shows that technical recruiters—especially those placing AI/ML engineers and cybersecurity roles—are still commanding premium compensation. Some senior tech recruiters are making $140,000+ base with commission potential pushing total comp over $200,000.

Executive recruiters are also doing fine. [Association of Executive Search and Leadership Consultants](https://www.aesc.org/) reports that retainer-based search consultants saw compensation increase 8% in 2025. Turns out, C-suite searches still pay well.

## What This Means Going Forward

If you got into recruiting for the money, you might want to rethink your strategy. The days of making $150,000 as a mid-level corporate recruiter are gone unless you're in a very specialized niche. The market has normalized, which means recruiting is back to being a decent-paying job instead of a get-rich-quick scheme.

The good news? The people who stick around will actually be good at this. The pandemic-era recruiter boom brought in a lot of people who had no business being in talent acquisition. As compensation normalizes, the tourists will leave and the professionals will remain. Silver linings, folks.
