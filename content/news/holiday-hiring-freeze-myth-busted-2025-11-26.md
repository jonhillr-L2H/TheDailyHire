Happy Thanksgiving Eve! While you're preparing to stuff your face with turkey, let me stuff your brain with some data that might change how you approach your job search this holiday season.

## The Numbers Don't Lie (Unlike Your Uncle's Political Takes)

According to [LinkedIn's latest hiring data](https://www.linkedin.com), November and December consistently show 15-20% fewer job postings than peak hiring months. And yeah, that sounds bad. But here's the kicker: they also show 30-40% fewer applicants. Do the math. Your competition just went home for eggnog.

[Indeed's 2024 Year-End Report](https://www.indeed.com) revealed that 67% of companies continue hiring through the holidays, with many pushing to fill roles before year-end budget resets. Tech companies, healthcare organizations, and retail (duh) are particularly aggressive about December hiring.

ZipRecruiter's data shows that candidates who apply between Thanksgiving and New Year's have a 23% higher response rate from employers. Twenty. Three. Percent. That's not a rounding error, folks.

## Why Companies Are Still Hiring (Besides Desperation)

First, budget cycles. Most companies operate on calendar-year budgets. If they don't fill approved roles by December 31st, those headcount allocations often vanish faster than pie at a family gathering. HR teams are scrambling to justify next year's hiring budget, and empty seats don't make compelling PowerPoints.

Second, Q1 readiness. Smart companies know that January is chaos. New projects kick off, people return from vacation with fresh "I quit" energy, and everyone's trying to hit the ground running. Hiring in December means onboarding in January, which means productivity in February. It's strategic, not seasonal.

Third, less competition from other employers. While you're assuming everyone's in hiring freeze mode, the companies that ARE hiring have a clear field. They're snatching up talent while their competitors are auto-replying with "Happy Holidays, we'll review your application in January."

## What This Means for Your Search

Don't pause your job search because Mariah Carey is back on the radio. This is actually peak opportunity season if you're willing to work while others are food-coma'ing.

Keep applying. Keep networking. Keep interviewing. The recruiter on the other end might be wearing a turkey sweater, but they're still looking at their requisition dashboard wondering why it's not filled yet.

And hey, if you DO get an interview scheduled between now and New Year's? You're probably talking to a hiring manager who's actually motivated to fill the role. The tire-kickers have already checked out.

So tomorrow, be grateful for your blessings. But Friday? Get back to applying. Those jobs aren't going to fill themselves, and the competition is currently in a tryptophan-induced nap.

Happy Thanksgiving, and may your inbox be full of interview requests instead of Black Friday spam.
