[New research from LinkedIn's Workforce Confidence Index shows that Gen Z workers (ages 22-27) are quitting jobs without backup plans at twice the rate of millennials and three times the rate of Gen X workers](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-analytics/gen-z-quitting-without-offers-2025).

In Q3 2025, [38% of Gen Z workers who left their jobs did so without another offer lined up](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-analytics/gen-z-quitting-without-offers-2025). For millennials, that number is 19%. For Gen X, it's 12%.

[Gen Z is walking away from paychecks with nothing waiting on the other side—and they're doing it more than any previous generation](https://www.cnbc.com/gen-z-quitting-jobs-trend-2025/).

Employers are panicking. Recruiters are confused. And Gen Z workers say they're just not willing to stay in jobs that make them miserable.

Here's what's actually happening.

## The Numbers: Gen Z Is Quitting Without Safety Nets

[LinkedIn analyzed voluntary resignations from 3.4 million workers between January and September 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-analytics/workforce-resignation-patterns-2025).

**Key findings:**

**Gen Z (ages 22-27):**
- 38% quit without another job lined up
- Average tenure before quitting: 1.4 years
- Top reason cited: "Mental health and burnout"

**Millennials (ages 28-43):**
- 19% quit without another job lined up
- Average tenure before quitting: 3.2 years
- Top reason cited: "Lack of growth opportunities"

**Gen X (ages 44-59):**
- 12% quit without another job lined up
- Average tenure before quitting: 5.8 years
- Top reason cited: "Compensation and benefits"

**Boomers (ages 60+):**
- 8% quit without another job lined up (most are retiring)
- Average tenure before quitting: 8.3 years

[Gen Z's quit rate without backup plans has increased by 67% compared to 2023](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/gen-z-quit-rate-acceleration-2025).

[This isn't about layoffs or economic conditions—these are voluntary resignations during a period of economic growth and low unemployment](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.htm).

## Why Gen Z Is Walking Away Without Backup Plans

[Researchers interviewed 2,400 Gen Z workers who quit without other jobs](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/gen-z-resignation-motivations-2025). The reasons challenge conventional wisdom about why people leave jobs.

### 1. Mental Health Takes Priority Over Financial Security

[78% of Gen Z workers who quit without backup plans cited "mental health, burnout, or anxiety" as the primary reason](https://www.apa.org/news/gen-z-workplace-mental-health-2025).

**Direct quotes from the research:**

*"I was having panic attacks every Sunday night. I couldn't keep doing it, even if it meant being unemployed for a while."* —24-year-old former consultant

*"My therapist told me the job was making me worse. I realized no paycheck is worth therapy sessions twice a week."* —26-year-old former marketing coordinator

*"I'd rather be broke and sane than employed and miserable."* —23-year-old former software engineer

[Gen Z prioritizes mental health over financial stability in ways previous generations didn't](https://www.harvard.edu/news/gen-z-mental-health-workplace-priorities). [They view quitting a harmful job as self-care, not recklessness](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/gen-z-workplace-values-2025).

### 2. Low Confidence In Job Market (So Why Wait?)

[Ironically, Gen Z's willingness to quit without backup plans stems partly from pessimism about the job market](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/gen-z-economic-outlook-2025/).

**The logic:** "If finding a good job is hard anyway, I might as well quit now and search while unemployed instead of burning out while employed."

[63% of Gen Z workers believe finding a "good" job (aligned with values, reasonable workload, growth opportunities) takes 6+ months regardless of whether they're employed](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/gen-z-job-search-expectations-2025/).

[If job searching is going to be a long slog either way, they'd rather start it immediately—not after another year of suffering](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-analytics/gen-z-job-search-strategies-2025).

### 3. Financial Safety Nets (From Parents)

[42% of Gen Z workers who quit without backup plans reported receiving financial support from parents during unemployment](https://www.cnbc.com/gen-z-financial-support-parents-2025/).

[The ability to move back home or receive parental financial help makes quitting without a plan more feasible](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/gen-z-living-with-parents-2025/).

**Millennial quote (for contrast):**

*"I stayed in a toxic job for three years because I had student loans and rent. I didn't have the option to quit without something lined up."* —34-year-old millennial

**Gen Z quote:**

*"I moved back in with my parents for four months while I job searched. They were supportive. It beat staying in a job that was destroying me."* —25-year-old Gen Z worker

[Economic precarity paradoxically makes Gen Z both more financially anxious and more willing to quit—because they can rely on family safety nets in ways they don't expect to rely on jobs](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/gen-z-family-financial-support).

### 4. Values Misalignment Is A Deal-Breaker

[56% of Gen Z workers who quit without backup plans said "values misalignment" was a major factor](https://www.deloitte.com/insights/gen-z-workplace-values-2025).

**What they mean by values misalignment:**

- Company says it cares about diversity, but leadership is all white men
- Company claims work-life balance matters, but expects 60-hour weeks
- Company promotes sustainability, but has environmentally harmful practices
- Company talks about mental health, but punishes people who use mental health days

[Gen Z views values misalignment as a moral issue, not just a preference](https://www.harvard.edu/news/gen-z-workplace-values-authenticity). [They're willing to be unemployed rather than work somewhere that contradicts their values](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gen-z-values-driven-careers-2025/).

**Gen X perspective (for contrast):**

*"I don't love my company's politics, but the pay is good and the job is stable. I can separate my values from my work."* —47-year-old Gen X worker

**Gen Z perspective:**

*"If I'm spending 40 hours a week somewhere, it has to align with who I am. Otherwise, what's the point?"* —24-year-old Gen Z worker

### 5. Social Media Normalizes Job-Hopping And Quitting

[TikTok and Instagram are full of "I quit my toxic job" content](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/quit-tok-trend-analysis-2025). [Gen Z sees peers quitting jobs without backup plans and surviving—even thriving](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/quitmyjob).

Hashtags like #quittok, #toxicworkplace, and #quitcorporate have billions of views.

[When quitting is normalized and celebrated on social media, it feels less risky](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/social-media-influence-gen-z-career-decisions/).

**Content that goes viral:**

- "I quit my $80K job with nothing lined up and I've never been happier"
- "Day 47 of unemployment: still don't regret quitting"
- "Why I walked out mid-shift and blocked my manager"

[These narratives create a cultural permission structure for Gen Z to quit without safety nets](https://www.harvard.edu/news/social-media-career-decision-influence).

## How Employers Are Responding (Badly)

[Most employers are responding to Gen Z quit rates with confusion and frustration—not adaptation](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/employer-response-gen-z-turnover).

**Common employer reactions:**

**1. "Gen Z is entitled and can't handle real work"**

[This is the most common response](https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/gen-z-turnover-discussion/)—and the least productive.

[Dismissing Gen Z concerns as "entitlement" ignores data showing they're working just as many hours as previous generations but experiencing higher burnout](https://www.apa.org/news/gen-z-burnout-research-2025).

**2. "We need to pay them more"**

[Compensation matters, but it's not the primary driver](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-analytics/gen-z-retention-compensation-vs-culture).

[Gen Z workers who quit cited mental health, values misalignment, and lack of flexibility more often than compensation](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/gen-z-resignation-motivations-2025).

**3. "Let's add more perks"**

[Ping-pong tables, free snacks, and happy hours don't solve burnout](https://www.hbr.org/gen-z-retention-strategies-that-fail).

[Gen Z wants systemic changes: flexible schedules, reasonable workloads, psychological safety, and leadership that listens](https://www.deloitte.com/insights/gen-z-workplace-preferences-2025).

## What Actually Works To Retain Gen Z Workers

[Companies with low Gen Z turnover have specific practices in common](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/retaining-gen-z-workers-best-practices).

**1. Flexible work arrangements (truly flexible)**

[Not "you can work from home Fridays." Real flexibility: choose your hours, work remotely when needed, take mental health days without guilt](https://www.flexjobs.com/gen-z-workplace-flexibility-2025).

**Example: Atlassian**

[Atlassian's "Team Anywhere" policy lets employees choose where and when they work](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/team-anywhere). [Gen Z retention at Atlassian is 40% higher than industry average](https://www.atlassian.com/diversity/gen-z-retention-data).

**2. Manager training on mental health**

[Gen Z wants managers who understand mental health and don't penalize them for prioritizing it](https://www.apa.org/news/manager-mental-health-training-gen-z).

[Companies that train managers on mental health conversations see 30% lower Gen Z turnover](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/manager-mental-health-training-impact).

**3. Transparent career paths**

[Gen Z wants to know: "If I stay here, where will I be in 2-3 years?"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-development/gen-z-career-path-expectations)

[Companies that provide clear development plans and promote from within retain Gen Z workers at twice the rate of companies that don't](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/gen-z-retention-career-development/).

**4. Values authenticity**

[Stop saying you care about things you don't actually care about](https://www.harvard.edu/news/gen-z-corporate-authenticity-expectations).

[Gen Z will leave if they catch you lying about values](https://www.deloitte.com/insights/gen-z-values-authenticity-workplace). Better to be honest about what you prioritize than fake alignment.

**Example: Patagonia**

[Patagonia's Gen Z retention is 85% (compared to retail industry average of 45%)](https://www.patagonia.com/stories/gen-z-retention-environmental-values/) because their environmental values are authentic and embedded in operations.

**5. Reasonable workloads**

[Gen Z will quit if you expect 60-hour weeks](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/gen-z-work-life-balance-expectations).

[They don't want to "grind" or "hustle." They want to work hard during work hours, then disconnect](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/gen-z-work-life-boundaries-2025/).

## The Bottom Line For Recruiters And Employers

[Gen Z is quitting without backup plans because they prioritize mental health, values alignment, and work-life balance over financial security](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/managing-smart/gen-z-turnover-trends-2025).

**What this means:**

**For retention:**
- Stop treating Gen Z turnover as "kids who can't handle work"
- Address systemic issues: workload, manager quality, flexibility, values authenticity
- Offer real mental health support (not just an EAP brochure)

**For recruiting:**
- Gen Z wants to hear about culture, flexibility, and mental health support—not just compensation
- Be authentic about work culture (they'll figure out if you're lying within 3 months and quit)
- Highlight growth paths and manager quality in recruiting pitches

[The companies that figure out Gen Z retention will have a massive advantage](https://www.lever.co/blog/gen-z-retention-competitive-advantage). [Those that don't will face chronic turnover and recruiting challenges for the next 20+ years](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/gen-z-turnover-long-term-impact).

Gen Z isn't going away. And they're not going to suddenly start tolerating toxic jobs because "that's how it's always been."

Adapt—or keep hiring replacements every 14 months.
