Recruiting has always been stressful. But 2025 has turned stress into a full-blown mental health crisis. [41% of recruiters are actively considering leaving the profession within the next year](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-burnout-survey-2025), citing burnout, unrealistic expectations, and deteriorating mental health.

[The average recruiter tenure has dropped to 2.3 years, down from 3.8 years in 2019](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/recruiter-retention-trends-2025). [Turnover among corporate recruiters hit 34% in 2025—higher than the positions they're trying to fill](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-turnover-rates-2025/).

**The profession responsible for solving everyone else's talent problems can't retain its own people.**

## The Numbers Are Devastating

[A recent survey of 2,400 recruiters paints a bleak picture](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-mental-health-survey-2025):

**41% considering leaving recruiting entirely**: Not switching companies—switching careers. [They want out of recruiting altogether](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-career-change-trends).

**68% report symptoms of burnout**: [Exhaustion, cynicism, reduced efficacy—the clinical definition of burnout](https://www.workforce.com/news/recruiter-burnout-symptoms-prevalence).

**52% say their mental health has declined in the past year**: [Anxiety, depression, and stress-related health issues are increasing](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-mental-health-decline-2025/).

**37% are taking medication for anxiety or depression**: [Up from 22% in 2022](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-mental-health-medication-use).

**61% report crying at work or because of work in the past six months**: [The emotional toll is severe and pervasive](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-emotional-exhaustion-2025).

**73% say their company provides inadequate mental health support**: [Despite increasing awareness, actual resources remain limited](https://www.hrdive.com/news/employer-mental-health-support-recruiting/).

## What's Driving The Crisis

Multiple factors are converging to create impossible working conditions:

**Economic whiplash**: [Mass hiring in 2021-2022, mass layoffs in 2023, selective hiring in 2024-2025](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-economic-volatility-2025). [Recruiters went from heroes to expendable overhead in 18 months](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-job-security-concerns/).

**Impossible metrics**: [Companies expect recruiters to fill 30-40 requisitions simultaneously while maintaining "quality of hire" and "candidate experience" metrics](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-workload-analysis-2025). [The math doesn't work—you can't do deep sourcing for 40 roles at once](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/recruiter-capacity-challenges).

**Constant rejection**: [Recruiters face rejection from candidates, hiring managers, and executives daily](https://www.workforce.com/news/recruiter-psychological-impact-rejection). [Candidates ghost them, hiring managers override their recommendations, executives cancel reqs after months of work](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-frustration-factors-2025).

**No control over outcomes**: [Recruiters are held accountable for metrics they can't control](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-accountability-without-authority/). [They don't set compensation, they don't make final hiring decisions, they don't determine headcount—but they're blamed when positions don't fill](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-lack-of-control-analysis).

**Technology overwhelm**: [New ATS platforms, AI tools, sourcing technologies, and analytics dashboards are constantly being implemented](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/technology/recruiting-technology-change-fatigue). [Recruiters spend more time managing technology than talking to candidates](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-technology-administrative-burden/).

**Always-on culture**: [Candidates expect immediate responses](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/candidate-response-time-expectations). [Hiring managers demand instant updates](https://www.workforce.com/news/hiring-manager-expectations-recruiters). [Recruiters are checking email at 10pm and responding to LinkedIn messages on weekends](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-work-life-balance-2025).

## The Hiring Manager Problem

[The relationship between recruiters and hiring managers is often toxic](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-hiring-manager-relationship-dysfunction):

**Unrealistic requirements**: [Hiring managers want 10 years of experience for entry-level pay](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/unrealistic-job-requirements-2025). [They want senior-level skills at mid-level compensation](https://www.hrdive.com/news/compensation-expectations-disconnect/). [Recruiters spend hours explaining why requirements are impossible before managers begrudgingly compromise](https://www.workforce.com/news/job-requirement-negotiations-recruiter-time).

**Moving goalposts**: [Hiring managers change requirements mid-search](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/changing-job-requirements-recruiter-impact). ["Actually, we need someone with Python, not Java."](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/mid-search-requirement-changes) [After recruiters spent weeks sourcing Java developers](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-wasted-effort-changing-requirements/).

**Slow decision-making**: [Candidates are interviewed and then ghosted for weeks while hiring managers "think about it"](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/hiring-manager-decision-delays). [By the time managers decide, candidates have accepted other offers](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/slow-hiring-process-consequences).

**Disrespect for recruiting expertise**: [Hiring managers treat recruiters as administrative schedulers, not strategic partners](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-strategic-partner-perception-gap). ["Just post the job and send me resumes"](https://www.workforce.com/news/recruiter-professional-respect-issues) is a common attitude that dismisses recruiting expertise.

**Blame deflection**: [When positions don't fill, it's the recruiter's fault—never the low compensation, terrible culture, or unrealistic requirements](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-blame-culture-analysis/).

## The Candidate Behavior Factor

Candidate behavior has deteriorated significantly, adding to recruiter stress:

**Ghosting is rampant**: [Candidates schedule interviews and don't show up](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-ghosting-rates-2025). [They accept offers and never start](https://www.hrdive.com/news/offer-acceptance-no-show-rates/). [No call, no explanation—just silence](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/candidate-ghosting-trends).

**Application spam**: [Job seekers apply to everything using "Easy Apply" without reading job descriptions](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/easy-apply-quality-concerns-2025). [Recruiters spend hours screening completely unqualified candidates](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/application-volume-quality-disconnect).

**Negotiation games**: [Candidates accept offers, then use them as leverage for counteroffers](https://www.workforce.com/news/counteroffer-acceptance-trends). [Recruiters invest weeks in closing candidates who never intended to leave](https://www.hrdive.com/news/candidate-offer-negotiation-tactics/).

**Lack of communication**: [Candidates don't respond to messages, miss callbacks, and provide no feedback](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/candidate-communication-challenges-2025). [Recruiters send 20 messages to get one response](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/candidate-response-rates-declining).

**Unrealistic expectations**: [Entry-level candidates demanding senior-level compensation and full remote work with zero negotiation](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/entry-level-candidate-expectations-2025). [Recruiters spend time managing expectations that weren't realistic to begin with](https://www.workforce.com/news/candidate-expectation-management-burden).

## The Layoff Trauma

[Many recruiters experienced or witnessed mass layoffs in 2023-2024](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-layoff-impact-2025):

[Recruiting teams were often eliminated entirely—not reduced, eliminated](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-team-eliminations-2023-2024/). [Recruiters who survived layoffs now manage workloads that previously required three people](https://www.workforce.com/news/post-layoff-recruiter-workloads).

[The message was clear: recruiters are overhead, not strategic value](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-strategic-value-perception). [When budgets tighten, recruiting is cut first and restored last](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-budget-priority-analysis).

[Recruiters who lived through 2023 layoffs are dealing with PTSD-like symptoms](https://www.hrdive.com/news/workplace-trauma-recruiter-layoffs/). [Hypervigilance about company performance, anxiety about job security, difficulty trusting leadership](https://www.workforce.com/news/post-layoff-psychological-impact-recruiters).

## The Compensation Insult

Here's the kicker: [recruiters are consistently underpaid relative to the revenue impact they create](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/compensation-benefits/recruiter-compensation-analysis-2025).

[Median corporate recruiter salary: $62,000](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Corporate_Recruiter/Salary). [Cost of a bad hire: $50,000-150,000](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/cost-of-bad-hire-2025). [Value of a quality hire: $200,000-500,000 over tenure](https://www.hrdive.com/news/quality-hire-value-analysis/).

[Recruiters generate millions in hiring value annually while earning entry-level wages](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-value-compensation-disconnect-2025).

[Sales roles with equivalent performance metrics pay 2-3x more with commission structures](https://www.workforce.com/news/recruiter-sales-compensation-comparison). [Recruiters deliver similar outcomes—finding and closing candidates—but are paid like administrators](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/compensation-benefits/recruiter-pay-equity-issues).

## What Companies Are (Mostly) Not Doing

Despite growing awareness of recruiter burnout, [most companies aren't implementing meaningful solutions](https://www.hrdive.com/news/employer-response-recruiter-burnout-2025):

**Requisition load management**: [Companies continue assigning 30-40 reqs per recruiter](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-req-load-standards-2025). [Industry best practice is 15-20 for quality hiring](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/optimal-recruiter-workload-analysis).

**Mental health resources**: [73% of recruiters say their company's mental health benefits are inadequate](https://www.workforce.com/news/mental-health-benefits-recruiting-teams). [EAP programs are offered but rarely promoted or utilized](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eap-utilization-rates-recruiters/).

**Career development**: [Recruiting is often a dead-end role with limited advancement opportunities](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-career-progression-limitations). [The path from recruiter to senior recruiter to...what?](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/recruiter-career-advancement-challenges)

**Compensation improvements**: [Despite talent shortages, recruiter pay hasn't increased significantly](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Corporate_Recruiter/Salary/recruiter-wage-stagnation). [Commission structures remain rare in corporate recruiting](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-commission-models-adoption).

**Boundary setting**: [Companies encourage "always on" culture](https://www.workforce.com/news/always-on-culture-recruiting-teams). [Recruiters are expected to respond to candidates and hiring managers 24/7](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-availability-expectations).

## What's Actually Helping

The few companies addressing recruiter burnout are implementing:

**Reasonable req loads**: [Capping recruiters at 15-20 requisitions maximum](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-capacity-best-practices-2025). [Hiring additional recruiters instead of overloading existing ones](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-team-sizing-strategies/).

**Recruiting coordinators**: [Hiring coordinators to handle scheduling, logistics, and administrative tasks](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/recruiting-coordinator-impact). [Frees recruiters to focus on sourcing and relationship building](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiting-coordinator-efficiency-gains).

**Mental health days**: [Offering dedicated mental health PTO separate from vacation time](https://www.workforce.com/news/mental-health-pto-policies-2025). [No questions asked, no justification needed](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/mental-health-days-implementation).

**Hiring manager training**: [Teaching managers how to write realistic job descriptions, make timely decisions, and respect recruiting expertise](https://www.hrdive.com/news/hiring-manager-training-programs-2025). [Treating recruiting as a partnership, not a service desk](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/hiring-manager-recruiter-collaboration).

**Commission or bonus structures**: [Implementing performance-based pay tied to quality hires and retention](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-incentive-compensation-models-2025). [Aligning recruiter compensation with outcomes](https://www.workforce.com/news/recruiter-performance-pay-structures).

**Boundaries and response time expectations**: [Setting clear expectations that recruiters aren't on-call 24/7](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-work-life-balance-policies). [Candidate response within 24 business hours, not 24 minutes](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-response-time-standards/).

## The Recruiters Who Left

Talking to former recruiters reveals common themes:

[Many transitioned to HR business partner roles, talent development, or people operations](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-career-transitions-2025). [They wanted to stay in people-focused work but needed to escape the constant pressure of hiring](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/former-recruiters-career-paths).

[Others moved to sales, account management, or customer success](https://www.workforce.com/news/recruiter-to-sales-career-transitions). [The skills transfer well—relationship building, pipeline management, objection handling](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiting-skills-transferability-analysis).

[Some left corporate recruiting for agency/search firm roles with commission potential](https://www.hrdive.com/news/corporate-to-agency-recruiter-transitions/). [Better pay, more autonomy, clearer performance metrics](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/agency-vs-corporate-recruiting-comparison).

**Almost none regret leaving.** [Former recruiters report better work-life balance, improved mental health, and higher job satisfaction](https://www.workforce.com/news/former-recruiter-career-satisfaction-survey).

## The Bottom Line

[Recruiting is in a retention crisis because the job has become unsustainable](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiting-profession-sustainability-crisis). [Impossible workloads, inadequate compensation, constant rejection, and zero control over outcomes are driving experienced recruiters out](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiter-exodus-analysis-2025/).

[Companies that don't address this will face a future where they can't hire recruiters to hire anyone else](https://www.eremedia.com/ere/recruiter-shortage-hiring-impact-2025). [The profession that finds talent for every other role can't find—or keep—talent for itself](https://www.workforce.com/news/recruiting-profession-irony-retention).

If you're a recruiter considering leaving: you're not alone, you're not weak, and you're not failing. [The job is broken, not you](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-burnout-validation-2025).

If you lead recruiting teams: [your people are drowning](https://www.hrdive.com/news/recruiting-leader-team-burnout-response/). [Reduce req loads, increase pay, provide real mental health support, and set boundaries](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/preventing-recruiter-burnout-strategies).
