Video resumes have been "the next big thing in recruiting" approximately twelve times since 2010. Every few years, someone launches a platform, promises to revolutionize hiring, gets some press, and then disappears into obscurity.

[This time feels different](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-resumes-mainstream-2025). Major ATS platforms are building video resume capabilities natively. Gen Z candidates are creating them proactively. And companies across industries are requesting or requiring them for certain roles.

After fifteen years of false starts, video resumes are actually happening.

## What's Different This Time

[Previous waves of video resume platforms failed for predictable reasons](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-resume-failures-history/698234/): limited adoption, discrimination concerns, poor candidate experience, and no integration with existing workflows.

What changed:

**Native ATS integration**: [Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, and other major ATS platforms now support video resume uploads and playback](https://www.lever.co/blog/video-resume-features-2025). It's not a separate platform—it's built in.

**Async video interviews normalized it**: [The pandemic made async video interviews standard](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/async-video-interview-adoption). Video resumes are a natural extension.

**Gen Z expects it**: [Gen Z grew up creating video content](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gen-z-video-communication/). TikTok, Instagram, YouTube—video is their native communication format.

**Mobile recording quality improved**: [You can record professional-quality video on any smartphone now](https://www.wired.com/story/smartphone-video-quality-2024/). No special equipment needed.

**AI analysis made it scalable**: [AI tools can analyze video resumes at scale—tone, communication style, energy level](https://www.hireVue.com/products/video-assessments). Recruiters don't need to watch 200 videos manually.

**Standardized formats emerged**: [30-90 second intro videos became the norm](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/video-resume-best-practices-2025/), not 10-minute monologues. Format clarity helped adoption.

## Who's Actually Using Video Resumes

This isn't experimental anymore. [Major employers are implementing video resumes for specific roles and hiring programs](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-resume-adoption-companies-2025):

**Retail and hospitality**: [Companies like Target, Marriott, and Chipotle request video resumes for customer-facing roles](https://www.retaildive.com/news/video-resumes-retail-hiring/). They want to see communication skills and personality.

**Sales roles**: [Tech companies and B2B firms use video resumes to assess communication and presence for sales positions](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/video-resumes-sales-hiring/).

**Remote positions**: [Companies hiring fully remote workers request video resumes to evaluate virtual communication skills](https://www.remotework.com/blog/video-resumes-remote-hiring).

**Campus recruiting**: [Major companies piloting video resumes for entry-level and intern programs](https://www.naceweb.org/talent-acquisition/video-resumes-campus-recruiting/).

**Creative roles**: [Marketing, design, and content positions where communication and presentation matter](https://www.creativepool.com/magazine/video-resumes-creative-roles).

**Executive search firms**: [Even senior-level recruiting is experimenting with video resumes as part of initial screening](https://www.forbes.com/sites/executive-search-video-resumes/).

## What Candidates Are Actually Creating

[The format has standardized around short, focused intros](https://www.themuse.com/advice/video-resume-format-2025):

**30-60 second elevator pitch**: Who you are, what you do, what you're looking for. [Think TikTok-length, not YouTube documentary](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/video-resume-length-optimal/).

**Professional but authentic**: [Not overly scripted or polished](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/authentic-video-resumes). Personality matters more than production value.

**Specific to the role or company**: [Generic video resumes don't work](https://www.lever.co/blog/personalized-video-resumes/). Candidates create custom videos for specific applications.

**Supplement, not replacement**: [Video resumes accompany traditional resumes, they don't replace them](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-resumes-supplement-traditional).

**Mobile-first**: [Most are recorded on smartphones](https://www.wired.com/story/mobile-video-resume-tools/), using apps like Loom, Instagram, or built-in ATS features.

## The Discrimination Concerns (And How They're Being Addressed)

[Video resumes raise obvious bias concerns](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/video-resumes-discrimination-risk):

**Visual bias**: [Seeing someone's race, age, gender, and appearance introduces bias that text resumes partially hide](https://www.hbr.org/2024/video-resume-bias-research).

**Accent and speech patterns**: [Video reveals accents, speech impediments, and communication styles that could trigger bias](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-resume-accent-bias).

**Socioeconomic signals**: [Background, lighting, and production quality can signal socioeconomic status](https://www.forbes.com/sites/video-resume-inequality/).

**Disability disclosure**: [Visible disabilities are disclosed immediately in video, whereas text resumes don't reveal them](https://www.ada.gov/resources/video-resumes-disability-considerations/).

[Companies implementing video resumes are addressing these concerns through structured approaches](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-resume-bias-mitigation-2025):

**Standardized questions**: Everyone answers the same prompts. [Reduces subjective evaluation](https://www.lever.co/blog/standardized-video-resume-prompts/).

**Blind review options**: [Some platforms allow audio-only review or blur backgrounds to reduce visual bias](https://www.hireVue.com/products/bias-mitigation).

**AI-assisted analysis**: [AI evaluates content and communication skills, not appearance](https://www.pymetrics.ai/blog/video-assessment-bias-reduction).

**Training for reviewers**: [Companies train hiring teams on bias recognition before implementing video resumes](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/unconscious-bias-training-video-resumes).

**Optional, not required**: [Many companies make video resumes optional to avoid screening out candidates uncomfortable with video](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/optional-video-resumes/).

## The Gen Z Effect

[Gen Z's comfort with video is accelerating adoption](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gen-z-video-resumes-preference/):

**They're creating them proactively**: [Gen Z candidates are uploading video resumes to LinkedIn, personal websites, and applications even when not requested](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/gen-z-video-resumes).

**They prefer video over text**: [Research shows Gen Z would rather record a video intro than write a cover letter](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/gen-z-video-vs-text-preference/).

**They're better at it**: [Growing up with TikTok and Instagram means Gen Z knows how to communicate on camera](https://www.wired.com/story/gen-z-video-communication-advantage/).

**They expect employers to watch**: [Gen Z views employers who won't review video resumes as outdated](https://www.themuse.com/advice/gen-z-employer-expectations-video).

**They're setting the standard**: [As Gen Z becomes a larger share of the workforce, their preferences are reshaping recruiting norms](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/gen-z-influence-recruiting-2025).

## The Platforms Making It Happen

**HireVue**: [The OG video interview platform now offers video resume capabilities](https://www.hirevue.com/products/video-resumes). AI-powered analysis at scale.

**Loom**: [Originally for async work communication, now widely used for video resumes](https://www.loom.com/use-cases/recruiting). Simple, shareable, familiar to candidates.

**LinkedIn**: [Testing video resume features directly on profiles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-resumes-linkedin-testing/). Could be a game-changer for mainstream adoption.

**Spark Hire**: [Dedicated video interviewing platform with video resume functionality](https://www.sparkhire.com/products/video-resumes/).

**Native ATS features**: [Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday building video resume support into their platforms](https://www.lever.co/blog/video-resume-features-2025).

**TikTok Resumes**: [TikTok piloted a resume program in 2021 and is expanding it](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/tiktok-resumes). Video resumes as TikTok videos.

## What Recruiters Are Learning

[Early adopters are figuring out what works](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-resume-recruiter-insights-2025):

**Watch for energy and authenticity, not polish**: [Overly scripted videos feel robotic](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/authentic-video-resumes-hiring/). Conversational and genuine beats perfectly produced.

**Communication matters more than content**: [You're assessing how someone communicates, not what they say](https://www.lever.co/blog/video-resume-communication-assessment/). Presence, tone, and clarity reveal fit.

**Short is better**: [Videos over 90 seconds rarely get watched fully](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-resume-length-completion-rates/700456/).

**Use it as a filter, not a full assessment**: [Video resumes help decide who to interview, not who to hire](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-resume-screening-stage).

**Be transparent about how they're used**: [Candidates want to know if humans or AI are reviewing videos](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/video-resume-transparency/).

## The Roles Where Video Resumes Make Sense

Not every role needs a video resume. [They're most valuable where communication and presence matter](https://www.themuse.com/advice/when-video-resumes-make-sense):

✅ **Sales and business development**: Communication is the job.

✅ **Customer-facing roles**: Retail, hospitality, support—personality matters.

✅ **Remote positions**: Virtual communication skills are critical.

✅ **Marketing and creative**: Presentation and storytelling are core skills.

✅ **Teaching and training**: Ability to explain and engage on camera matters.

❌ **Highly technical roles where communication isn't primary**: Software engineering (unless for senior/leadership roles).

❌ **Roles where bias risk outweighs benefit**: Entry-level positions with high volume where structured screening works better.

❌ **Industries with strict compliance**: Heavily regulated fields might avoid video to reduce discrimination risk.

## The Bottom Line

[Video resumes failed for fifteen years because they were a solution looking for a problem](https://www.hrdive.com/news/video-resume-adoption-2025/). Async video normalized the format. Gen Z made it expected. AI made it scalable. And ATS integration made it practical.

They're not replacing traditional resumes—they're supplementing them for roles where communication, personality, and presence matter.

[If you're recruiting for customer-facing, remote, or communication-heavy roles, video resumes are worth piloting](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/video-resume-implementation-guide-2025). Start with optional submissions, train reviewers on bias, and standardize evaluation criteria.

And if you're a candidate? [Learning to record a compelling 60-second video intro is now a career skill worth developing](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/video-resume-skills-2025/).
