          <h2>The Short Version</h2>
          <p>
            By using The Daily Hire, you agree: Our content is AI-generated entertainment, not professional advice.
            Don&apos;t be a jerk. Don&apos;t steal our stuff. We&apos;re not liable if you make business decisions based on robot-written articles.
          </p>

          <h2>AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>ðŸ¤– IMPORTANT:</strong> Everything on The Daily Hire is generated using artificial intelligence.
            This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>It&apos;s for entertainment and laughs</strong> - Not professional recruiting advice</li>
            <li><strong>Don&apos;t bet your career on it</strong> - Always verify important information with real experts</li>
            <li><strong>We can&apos;t guarantee accuracy</strong> - AI is smart but not perfect</li>
            <li><strong>Take it with a grain of salt</strong> - We&apos;re here for hot takes and good vibes, not legal counsel</li>
            <li><strong>No professional relationship</strong> - Reading our articles doesn&apos;t create any advisory relationship</li>
          </ul>
