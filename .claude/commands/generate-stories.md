## üé¨ Ready to Generate?

Once you understand all requirements, begin with:

**Step 1:** Read 2-3 existing stories from target category
**Step 2:** Search web for current trends
**Step 3:** Select topics and generate content
**Step 4:** Save with proper formatting
**Step 5:** AUTO-FETCH IMAGES using Lorem Picsum (see below)

## üñºÔ∏è AUTOMATIC IMAGE GENERATION

**CRITICAL:** After writing each story markdown file, you MUST automatically fetch and add a relevant image from Lorem Picsum.

### Process:
1. **Write the story** with all frontmatter fields EXCEPT imageUrl
2. **Use the Lorem Picsum helper** to fetch a relevant image:
   ```typescript
   import { fetchAndSaveArticleImage } from '../lib/images';

   const imagePath = await fetchAndSaveArticleImage(
     title,      // Article title from frontmatter
     category,   // 'news', 'tools', 'ai-funnies', or 'just-the-tip'
     slug,       // Filename without .md
     excerpt     // Article excerpt (not used but kept for compatibility)
   );
   ```
3. **Update the markdown** with the returned imagePath in the imageUrl field
4. **Images are automatically:**
   - Generated from Lorem Picsum (powered by Unsplash)
   - Downloaded to `/public/images/[category]/[slug].jpg`
   - 100% copyright-free for commercial blog use (Unsplash License)
   - Deterministic (same slug = same image)
   - High quality professional photos
   - Styled by category (news=grayscale, funnies=blur, etc.)

### Example Workflow:
```
1. Generate story ‚Üí content/news/new-recruiting-trend.md
2. Extract: title="New Recruiting Trend", category="news", slug="new-recruiting-trend"
3. Call: fetchAndSaveArticleImage(title, category, slug, excerpt)
4. Receives: /images/news/new-recruiting-trend.jpg
5. Update frontmatter: imageUrl: "/images/news/new-recruiting-trend.jpg"
6. Done! Story is complete with image
```

### Important Notes:
- **Always fetch images** - Never skip this step
- **One image per story** - Each article gets its own unique image
- **No API key needed** - Lorem Picsum is completely free, no authentication
- **No copyright issues** - All images are free for commercial blog use
